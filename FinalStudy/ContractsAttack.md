      - Apply predominant purpose to each individually

____

## Formation
### Basics
#### Promises
- A promise = a manifestation to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.
  - Jokes != Promises
    - Depends on if one of the parties could be justified in seriousness based on past dealing
      - See *[Pepsico](link)*
  - Not promises:
    - Mere statement of intent
    - Predictions
    - Opinions
    - Agreements to Agree

##### Bilateral Contract
- Preference to read Contracts as Bilateral
  - Both sides make a promise for future action/forbearance
  - Cannot be revoked after acceptance without breach

##### Unilateral Contract
- Offeror makes offer to exchange a promise of future perfomrmance with the ACTUAL performance of the offeree being the only valid means of acceptance of offer.
- Offeror cannot revoke after substantial performance

____

### Mutual Assent
- Mutual assent requires both offer & acceptance

#### Offer
- Identify Manifestation Objective Willingness
  - Outward actions are determinative not hidden intentions
  - Identify & describe negotiations
- Creation of a power of acceptance
  - Invitation to assent to acceptance
  - Must be communicated unless mailbox rule
  - Issues:
    - Offer not directed at specfic offeree
    - Contest & Reward Offers
    - Invitations to deal
    - Conditonal Acceptances
- Specify all necessary terms
  - Terms must be **definite** & **certain**
    - Common Law Terms:
      - Quantity
      - Time
      - Identity of Subject Matter
      - Parties
    - UCC Terms
      - Quantity
      - Reasonble Terms supplied by gap fillers

##### Termination of Offer
- Revocation
  - Expressly Communicated prior to acceptance
    - Exceptions:
      - Option Contract (Consideration to keep option open)
      - UCC Firm Offer
      - Unilateral Contract
        - Performance began
      - Detrimenal Reliance
        - Reasonable & Foreseeable Reliance
- Constructive Revocation
  - When offeree learns of conduct inconsistent with continuing ability to make a contract
- Rejection
  - Moment of Rejection expressed terminates offer and new offer required
- Counter Offer
  - Acts as a rejection and results in new offer to previous offeror, previous offer cannot be then accepted
- Death
  - Terminates offer
- Time
  - Reasonble amount of time passes
    - Examination of facts required to determine reasonabless
      - More Money: More Time
- Mailbox acceptance
  - Offeree has already mailed acceptance or performed on offer



##### Cases
- See [Lefkowitz](link)
  - Publishing an advertisement in a newspaper constituted a valid offer because it was clear, definite, and explicit.
- See [Lucy v. Zehmer](link)
  - Contract existed where defendants' words and actions warranted plaintiffs' reasonable belief that a contract had been formed to sell defendants' land despite defendants' claim that contract was intended as a joke.
- See [Ford Motor Credit v. Russell](link)
  - Automobile advertisement was not an offer to contract because a reasonable person would understand that not everyone qualifies for financing.
- See *[Nebraska Seed Co. v. Harsh](link)*
  - The court reversed a judgment for the buyer in a jury trial when the court found that the letter sent to the buyer constituted a mere invitation for the buyer to make an offer to the seller for the purchase of seed.
- See *[Leonard v. Pepsico](link)
  - Corporation's advertisement to give consumer a jet upon buying enough of its product was clearly made in jest and did not constitute a contract; overall tone of the advertisement was fanciful and statute of frauds was violated.

---
#### Acceptance
- Unequivocal agreement to the terms of acceptance that is communicated to the offeror by an offeree with the power of acceptance

- Objective Willingness
  - Outward manfiestation of conduct
  - Performance and Communicate (unilateral)
- Acceptance in accordance with "Master of Offer"
  - Bilateral Contract
    - Return Promise for Promise
      - Return promise = Acceptance OR;
      - Start of performance = **Manifestation of Acceptance**
  - Unilateral Contract
    - Acceptance requires performance or action
      - Once started offer is **irrevocable**
        - Acceptance only valid upon completion
- Power of Acceptance
  - Offeror must have directed to the offeree to accept
    - Intent of Offeror
      - Exceptions: Contest/Reward Offers
- Timely Acceptance
  - In specified and reasonble way
    - Silence only if based on previous conduct and custom
    - Offeree retain a benefit after reasonble opportunity to object
- Mailbox Rule: Timing of Acceptance ONLY
  - Sending acceptance/rejection is valid as soon as sent by offeree unless revocation received prior to acceptance
    - Exceptions
      - Irrevocable Offer
      - If **accepted and then rejected;** Mailbox rule still applies, no subsequent rejection applies
      - If offeree **rejects** and then sends acceptance; which ever is received/opened by offeror first applies
- Mirror Image Rule vs. Battle of Forms (UCC 2-207)
- Additional or Different Terms
  - Under Common Law = **Mirror Image Rule**
    - If any additional terms, results in Counter Offer
  - Under UCC 2-207 = Battle of Forms
    - Three Subparts
      - (1) Acceptance or Counter offer;
        - Counteroffer if new terms are **expressly conditioned** to the assent of additional terms
        - Acceptance if additional terms added **without** conditional acceptance to new terms
      - (2) If acceptance with additional/different terms, **which terms control**
        - Acceptance under (1) additional terms apply & both merchants
          - Exceptions to apply Gap Fillers
            - If both offer expressly limits acceptance to terms of original offer
            - New additional terms added **materially** alter deal
            - Offeror objects in a reasonble time
          - Some jurisdictions apply **Knockout Rule** and then use UCC Gap Filler
            - Distinction between Additional & Different Terms
      - (3) If Counter Offer; No K but parties perform as if there is a K, Court creates new K
        - Overlapping Terms
        - Gap Fillers

##### Cases
- See *[Ardente v Horan](link)*
  - Where a buyer's letter in response to the sellers' offer was only a conditional acceptance, he was not entitled to specific performance of the real estate sales contract because it served as a rejection of the offer and created no binding obligation.

### Consideration
- Consideration occurs when there is a bargained for exchange and the promisee incurs a legal detriment
- Adequacy of Consideraiton is not usually considered by Courts
  - Does not have to be balanced (Freedom to transact and make a bad deal)

#### Bargained-for-Exchange
##### Reciprocal Inducement & Legal Detriment
  - The promise induces the detriment and the detriment induces the promise
    - Promisor requires something in return from promisee
    - Promisor must bargain for either
      - Return promise (Bilateral)
      - Performance (Unilateral)
- Donative Promises
  - Promisor gets nothing in return for their promise = No Consideration
    - Promisee does not incur a **legal detriment**
- Conditional Gifts
  - Conditions that are not the detriment inducing the promise lack consideration
- Past Consideration
  - Promise was made after the legal detriment.
    - But examine Moral Obligation + Subsequent promise
- Forbearance of Legal Right
  - Promisee's forbearance will incur a legal detriment that is induced by promise
    - Mutual inducement still required and cannot be induced from past consideration
    - Governed by Good Faith Test
      - Forbearance to sue so long as promisee believes honestly they have claim to sue
- Illusory Promises
  - No commitment to deal or promise itself does not result in real legal detriment

##### Cases
- See [Hardest v. Smith](link)
  - Classic bargained for consideration. Deference to freedom of contract between autonomous citizens. No
need for law to interfere as long as consideration is apparent.
- See [Dougherty v. Salt](link)
  - Promisor’s motive is measured objectively. Court will not enforce promises of gifts, only bargained for exchanges.
- See [Maughs v. Porter](link)
  - Example of consideration when promisor benefits even though a conditional promise because the promisor did actually benefit from this arrangement (more people at his auction)
- See [Tramp Example](link)
  - Conditional gratuitous promises are not enforceable. There must be evidence that the promisor is getting something in return and/or a benefit from the condition they are imposing on the promisee.
- See [Hamer v. Sidway](link)
  - Nephew’s abstention is sufficient consideration, because his forbearance was him giving up some of his legal rights. Does not matter whether uncle benefited or not. Benefit to promisor OR Detriment to promisee is sufficient to qualify as consideration.
- See [Baehr v. Penn-O-Tex Oil Corp](link)
  - No consideration because there was no mutual inducement, and no bargaining. Forbearance may be evidence of consideration, but not in this case.
- See [Neuhoff v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co.](link)
  - In order for forbearance to serve as consideration there must be evidence that such forbearance induced the other party.
- See [Springstead v. Nees](link)
  - Consideration for the promise must rest upon the forbearance to exercise a legal right. Forbearance to assert either a legal or equitable claim is sufficient consideration. No consideration if you are giving up something you have no legal claim to.
- See [De Los Santos v. Great Western Sugar Co](link)
  - Mutuality of obligation is an essential element of every enforceable agreement. Mutuality is absent when only one of the contracting parties is bound to perform. An agreement which depends on the wish, will, or pleasure of one of the parties is not enforceable.
