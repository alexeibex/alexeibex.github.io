2. Right to Farm Defense:

<details><summary>§ 308 Right to Farm - New York</summary>
  <ol>
    <li></li>
      <ol>
        <li> The commissioner shall, in consultation with the state advisory council on agriculture, issue opinions upon request from any person as to whether particular agricultural practices are sound.</li>

        <li>Sound agricultural practices refer to those practices necessary for the on-farm production, preparation and marketing of agricultural commodities. Examples of activities which entail practices the commissioner may consider include, but are not limited to, operation of farm equipment; proper use of agricultural chemicals and other crop protection methods; direct sale to consumers of agricultural commodities or foods containing agricultural commodities produced on-farm; agricultural tourism; “timber operation,” as defined in subdivision fourteen of section three hundred one of this article and construction and use of farm structures. The commissioner shall consult appropriate state agencies and any guidelines recommended by the advisory council on agriculture. The commissioner may consult as appropriate, the New York state college of agriculture and life sciences and the U.S.D.A. natural resources conservation service, and provide such information, after the issuance of a formal opinion, to the municipality in which the agricultural practice being evaluated is located. The commissioner shall also consider whether the agricultural practices are conducted by a farm owner or operator as part of his or her participation in the AEM program as set forth in article eleven-A of this chapter. Such practices shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</li>

    </ol>

      <li>1. Upon the issuance of an opinion pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall publish a notice in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area surrounding the practice and notice shall be given in writing to the owner of the property on which the practice is conducted and any adjoining property owners. The opinion of the commissioner shall be final, unless within thirty days after publication of the notice a person affected thereby institutes a proceeding to review the opinion in the manner provided by article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.</li>

      <li>Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, on any land in an agricultural district created pursuant to section three hundred three or land used in agricultural production subject to an agricultural assessment pursuant to section three hundred six of this article, an agricultural practice shall not constitute a private nuisance, when an action is brought by a person, provided such agricultural practice constitutes a sound agricultural practice pursuant to an opinion issued upon request by the commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an aggrieved party from recovering damages for personal injury or wrongful death.</li>

      <li>The commissioner, in consultation with the state advisory council on agriculture, shall issue an opinion within thirty days upon request from any person as to whether particular land uses are agricultural in nature. Such land use decisions shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis</li>

      <li>The commissioner shall develop and make available to prospective grantors and purchasers of real property located partially or wholly within any agricultural district in this state and to the general public, practical information related to the right to farm as set forth in this article including, but not limited to right to farm disclosure requirements established pursuant to section three hundred ten of this article and section three hundred thirty-three-c of the real property law.</li>

Notes:
  1. Private Right of Action
    1. Landowners’ private nuisance action against farm owner arising out of owner’s use of liquid manure as fertilizer is not precluded by § 308, where landowners did not request or obtain opinion of commissioner as to whether use of manure was sound agricultural practice, because statute does not indicate that issuance of such opinion was intended to be prerequisite to suit, but rather, by describing particular circumstance in which agricultural practice will not be considered nuisance, suggests that burden is on party pursuing practice to show it is sound.
    - Concerned Area Residents for the Env't v Southview Farm, 834 F. Supp. 1410, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12393 (W.D.N.Y. 1993).
  1. Commissioner’s opinions
    1. Opinion issued by Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, under CLS Agr & M § 308, that farm owner’s manure management program was sound agricultural practice did not have to comply with State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), because (1) opinion was mere assessment of agricultural practice, not “action” under SEQRA and its implementing regulations, and (2) even if opinion were “action,” SEQRA exempts agricultural farm management practices from review. Pure Air & Water, Inc. v Davidsen, 246 A.D.2d 786, 668 N.Y.S.2d 248, 1998 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 294 (N.Y. App. Div. 3d Dep't), app. dismissed, 91 N.Y.2d 955, 671 N.Y.S.2d 716, 694 N.E.2d 885 (N.Y. 1998), app. denied, 92 N.Y.2d 807, 678 N.Y.S.2d 593, 700 N.E.2d 1229, 1998 N.Y. LEXIS 2807 (N.Y. 1998), app. dismissed, 93 N.Y.2d 1013, 697 N.Y.S.2d 567, 719 N.E.2d 928, 1999 N.Y. LEXIS 3941 (N.Y. 1999).
    2. Opinion issued by Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, under CLS Agr & M § 308, that farm owner’s manure management program was sound agricultural practice was not arbitrary or capricious where (1) associate environmental analyst in Department of Agriculture and Markets conducted investigation of owner’s program that included site review, discussions with 2 neighbors concerned about water quality, and consultations with person who prepared manure management plan and county director of environmental health, who tested water quality in wells in vicinity of farm, (2) there was no evidence of any degradation of water quality in neighboring wells, and (3) analyst also contacted Department of Environmental Conservation, which had no record of water quality violations at farm; § 308 does not contemplate that commissioner will perform independent tests, but rather that he will arrive at his decision in consultation with appropriate state agencies. Pure Air & Water, Inc. v Davidsen, 246 A.D.2d 786, 668 N.Y.S.2d 248, 1998 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 294 (N.Y. App. Div. 3d Dep't), app. dismissed, 91 N.Y.2d 955, 671 N.Y.S.2d 716, 694 N.E.2d 885 (N.Y. 1998), app. denied, 92 N.Y.2d 807, 678 N.Y.S.2d 593, 700 N.E.2d 1229, 1998 N.Y. LEXIS 2807 (N.Y. 1998), app. dismissed, 93 N.Y.2d 1013, 697 N.Y.S.2d 567, 719 N.E.2d 928, 1999 N.Y. LEXIS 3941 (N.Y. 1999).
    3. Storage of manure until it could be land-applied during favorable weather conditions and when crops could take advantage of nutrients in manure was superior method of manure management on particular farm where other alternatives, such as daily spreading, would have greater potential for creating water quality problems and other adverse off-farm effects. 1995 Op Comm Agr, Sound Agricultural Practice No. 95-2.
    4. Transportation of animal waste from one location of farm to another, on public road, for purpose of land application constituted “sound practice” despite complaints by neighbor, where only alternative route between barn and fields would require farmer to travel approximately 3 additional miles, and farmer reduced potential for manure spilling by improving his manure spreader. 1997 Op Comm Agr, Sound Agricultural Practice No. 97-3.
    5. Farm’s use of concrete structure to temporarily store horse manure, as it related to odor and ground water quality, was sound. 2001 Op Comm Agr. Sound Agricultural Practice No. 01-5.
  1. —Unsound practices
    1. Chicken manure storage and disposal practices conducted by farm as they related to effective fly management and odor control were not sound due to operator’s failure to (1) remove manure from poultry house storage pits every 10 days or less and maintain leak-free condition at all times, (2) inspect watering equipment in poultry houses for leaks daily, (3) use needed and appropriate pesticides to control flies in manure, and (4) incorporate manure into fields on day of application during summer months. 1993 Op Comm Agr, Sound Agricultural Practice No. 93-2.

-NOTE:THE RIGHT TO FARM: HOG-TIED AND NUISANCE-BOUND, 73 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1694
Over-application of manure which contains zinc, copper, chromium, arsenic, cadmium and lead from animal feed, builds up and affects fertility of the soil.
- States have enacted RTFs with the stated purpose of preventing the slow destruction of farmland as a result of expansion of urban areas into traditionally rural land.
- the National Agricultural Lands Study (NALS), warned  [*1697]  of a national crisis in farmland preservation.
- Complaints from residents "bombard" farmers. When new residents successfully sue farmers on a nuisance theory, the farmers often are forced to abandon their livelihood and sell their land to developers.
- . In 1880s, the United States farm population was twenty-two million; now fewer than five million people live on farms.
- A decrease in land devoted to farmland, with a seventeen percent drop between 1945 and 1990, has accompanied this decrease in farming population.
- Nuisance law can be summarized by the proposition that one may not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of another's property
-  Eller v. Koehler, 67 N.E. 89, 90-91 (Ohio 1903) (factors include nature and importance of defendant's business, nature and frequency of disturbance, injuries disturbance causes, character of neighborhood, past actions by either party taken to reduce injury, and cost and feasibility of preventive measures).
- Most RTFs, at the very least, reflect the legislative judgment that plaintiffs who "come to the nuisance" are to blame for their own troubles and hence should not be protected by nuisance law.
- NY RTF requiring written commissioner's ruling declaring "sound agricultural practice")
  - awarding reasonable costs and attorneys' fees if defendant prevails
- While the amount of farmland in metropolitan areas increased by nearly fifty percent between 1974 and 1982, the evidence suggests that prime farmland is better utilized in metropolitan areas than outside metropolitan areas.
- Consider, for example, the dilemma of residents of a development built near a farm that primarily harvests crops with a small livestock production. Imagine that the farm gradually becomes more livestock-intensive, until it becomes an annoyance for the residents. An RTF that does not provide that certain changes cause an agricultural operation to be considered "new," and hence unprotected, may prevent residents from suing on a nuisance theory. Since the original operation will not have been a nuisance at the time it began, and there have been changes in the vicinity of the farm (before the new nuisance producing land use), a court may find that the nuisance common law does not protect new residents.
- The misallocation of RTF protection occurs by protecting large operations that may not require immunity from nuisance suits and by protecting operations that actually contribute to the degradation of rural areas.
- Four generalizations arise from the available evidence about RTFs' effect on rural life. First, some courts have misinterpreted various provisions of the RTFs, usually the "changed circumstances in the vicinity" criterion. Second, when RTFs have been used successfully to defend against a nuisance action, they have generally protected operations that may degrade rural life. Third, some municipalities feel that RTFs limit their regulation of farm-related operations. Fourth, RTFs have had their greatest effect on informal resolution of land use conflict.
  - Growing disconnect between America's political system and its farming rural backbone population.
  - See Paul Rogers, Right to Farm vs. Right to Quiet Life: Neighbor Finds Law Is Not on His Side, Rec., N. N.J., Oct. 29, 1996, at A1, available in 1996 WL 6115243.
  - Farmers form one potential group of claimants to a property-for- personhood interest. When farmers speak in support of RTF legislation they often emphasize personal and familial links to the land, bolstering the assertion that farmers do not view their land and their livelihood as solely fungible commodities.
  - They express strong  [*1730]  desires to continue farming in the face of development even though it may be economically irrational. 197Link to the text of the note This relationship to land may be one that society wishes to privilege.
  - In this respect, farming communities value their connection with the land, given that agriculture enhances community development in various ways. American society also places cultural value on specific images of agrarian life. For many, rural values provide stability in the midst of change
- RTFs Lead to the Inefficient Allocation of Resources

- In the narrowest codification of the "coming to the nuisance" defense, an RTF gives the farmer an entitlement to cause a nuisance and protect this entitlement with a property rule. 214Link to the text of the note If adjoining landowners want to stop the farmer from polluting, they must buy the entitlement from the farmer. In Spur Industries v. Del E. Webb Development Co., 215Link to the text of the note the court granted the farmer an entitlement to cause nuisance but protected it with a liability rule. 216Link to the text of the note Following this approach, the court could set the price for the entitlement and force the farmer to sell to the developer. Depending on the relative positions of the court and the parties, one rule may lead to a more efficient allocation of resources.
  - Quiddetch v. Naturally grown beef
- Arguably, some positive externalities associated with farming, such as health and low food prices, are not easily internalized by agricultural operations, given that the externalities benefit a large, diffuse population.
- Because farmers are extremely efficient producers, they enable the rest of society to participate in other areas of the economy without having to worry about the production of their own food.
-  For instance, a farmer cannot charge the public for the sensory benefit enjoyed when driving by a strawberry field in full bloom. Thus, protection against nuisance suits may be thought necessary in order to make up for the fact that farms are not able to capture some of the social benefits that they produce

COMMENT: Preserving Our Heritage: Tools to Cultivate Agricultural Preservation in New York State, 17 Pace L. Rev. 591
- Agriculture produces about $ 3 billion gross cash income for New York State every year. It is the number two industry in the Hudson Valley, second only to tourism, which is itself dependent upon agriculture for its success because agriculture maintains attractive open spaces and rural flavor.
- "New York is a farm state."
- A study in Cayuga County found that eighteen percent of non-agricultural business was directly linked to the agriculture industry. 9Link to the text of the note Such businesses include equipment sales, farm centers such as Agway stores, veterinary services and products, and seed and fertilizer dealers.


- opinion issued upon request by the commissioner." Defendants note that no such opinion has been requested or issued in this case. The statute, however, does not indicate that the issuance of such an opinion was intended to be a prerequisite to suit. In fact, the language, by describing the particular circumstance in which an agricultural practice will not be considered a nuisance, suggests that the burden is on the party pursuing the practice to show that it is sound.
