# The Right To Exclude

## Trespass

### Trespass to Land
- No reason to deter conduct that does not cause any damages.
  - Can be no punitive damages if there are no actual damages
- Right to exclude by the individuals who own property.
- Facts in both cases
  - Both cases the "trespass" causes no damage to the land in question
    - Both owners were not actually using the land for any purpose


### Repeated Trespass
- Injuntive Relief
- *[Baker v. Howard County Hunt]*


### Building Encroachment
- Continuous Trespass
- Damages v. Injunction/Specific Performance
- *[Pile v. Pedrick](Link)*
- *[Golden Press Inc. v. Rylands](Link)*

### Mistaken Improver
- *[Producers Lumber & Supply Co. v. Olney Building Co.](Link)*

# Limits & Enforcements on the Right to Exclude
## Criminal Action
### Criminal Laws Protecting Real Property
- Originally Common-law crime until statutory creation.
  - Modesty of penalties raises questions about the function of laws.
- Protection of the right to exclude
  - Landowners may use "self-help"
  - Defined by "reasonable force" to expel unwanted intruders from the land
    - No deadly force (spring guns)
- Criminal Statutes for trespass then provide an alternative to landowner self-help.
  - Crime for refusal to leave land in possession of another only after **being notified to do so**
    - Affirmative burden on landowner to "notify"
      - Example: Signs
    - Provides establishment of requisite scienter on part of ∆ to impose criminal liability
- Offenses involving buildings or occupied strucutres carry larger weight
  - Criminal law as protection of people over things/property
    - Arson
      - "...Destruction of a building/structure of another"
    - Burglary
      - "Enters a building or structure..."

## Civil Actions

### Civil Actions Protecting Real Property
- Civil: Trespass
  - Protect the interest in exclusive possesion of land.
    - Trespass = Used to vindicate the interest that a person in actual possession has in exclusive possession of land
- Civil: Ejectment
    - Ejectment = Used to vindicate the interest of a person who has title to land against a person wrongfully in possession.
      - Example: Building Encroachment
        - Tenant in possession is the only one who can bring an action in trespass.
        - π/Owner would have to sue in ejectment
  - Damages Awarded = damages (past) or injunctions (future)
- Civil: Nuisance
  - Protect the interest in use and enjoyment of land
  - Damages Awarded = damages/injunctive relief

### Civil Actions Protecting Personal Property
- Civil: Replevin
  - Action for recovery of personal property that the defendant wrongfully took.
- Civil: Conversion
- Civil: Trespass to Chattels
  - *[Intel Corp. v. Hamidi](link)*


## Self Help
- Enforcement of Property Rights without the direct involvment of the legal system.
  - Important in preserving the general structure of ownership than formal legal remedies
  - Used more often
- Right v. Privilege
  - Right = A claim that one person has against one or more others, which corresponds to a duty that these others have toward the one with the right.
  - Privilege = A freedom to act in certain ways without interference from others, which corresponds to a "no-right" in the others to interfere with the one exercising the privilege.
- Self-Help can be thought of as a type of privilege assoicated with ownership.
- Controversial when it involves the use of force as opposed to passive devices like fences and locks.
  - Person in possession can generally use reasonable force "to prevent/terminate an unlawful entry or other trespass upon land or a tresspass against the unlawful carrying away of tangible, movable property"
- Self-Help Eviction
    - The common law allowed landlords to resort to peaceable self help, but the court here held that the landlord had to use a judicial process.
      - *[Berg v. Wiley](link)*
    - In jurisdictions that still permit self-help, recovery of possession (personal) must be accomplished without a **breach of the peace**.
      - Breach of Peace = Without a signifcant threshold of violence
      - *[Williams v. Ford Motor Credit Company](link)*
    - The modern rule is that self-help is never available to dispossess a tenant who is in possession and has not abandoned or voluntarily surrendered the premises.
    - Modern Trend Allows for Self-Help in regards to Commercial Leases.


# Exception to the Right to Exclude
- Necessity
  - *[Ploof v. Putnam](Link)*
  - Shifting of Rights
    - Conditions of necessity shift the right to exclude from the landowner to the person entering under conditions of necessity.
  - Suspension of Rights for Damages
    - Landowner still has the right to exclude, but under conditions of necessity can only vindicate that right by seeking a payment of damages for any damage caused by the intruder.
    - Necessity suspends other modes of protection the landowner can ordinarily invoke such as the privilege of self help and the right to obtain an injunction.
  - Unjust enrichment
    - Necessity defense negates any liability in tort for trespass, and the damages are a form of restitution for unjust enrichment to the intruder.
- Custom
  - *[McConico v. Singleton]*
- Public Accommodations Laws
  - Owners of public accommodations, in contrast have a much more qualified right to exclude.
  - Subject to a general duty of nondiscrimination among customers
    - Must provide services to customers on a first come, first served basis + must charge reaonable rates for the services provide
