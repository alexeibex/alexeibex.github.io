## Forms of Ownership
### Ownership Between People
#### Concurrent Ownership
- A present estate in real or personal property can be simultaneously owned by 2+ persons, each holding the right to concurrent possession. This reflects the notion that ownership has divisions in 2 dimensions:
  - Horizontal Divisions (over time)
  - Vertical Divisions (at any given moment in time).
- 4 basic types of **concurrent estates**:
  - **Tenants in common**
  - **Joint Tenants**
  - Tenancy by the entirety
  - Community property

##### Tenancy in Common
- Separate but undivided interest
  - Example: O conveys property to A and B
    - Modern Rule: Presumed by Default
  - Separately Alienable
  - The interest of each is descendable and may be conveyed by deed or will.
  - No survivorship rights: i.e., the interests are distinct even if one owner dies.
  - No Rights against one another
  - Each tenant owns an undivided share of the whole.
    - Can be equal OR unequal

##### Joint Tenancy
- Regarded as a single owner
- Both have a **right of survivorship** — so if one dies, that tenant’s interest is simply extinguished.
- Four **unities** are required:
  1. **Time**: All interests must be acquired simultaneously.
  2. **Title**: All interests must be acquired by the **same instrument** or by joint adverse possession.
  3. **Interest**: All must have **equal** undivided shares and **identical interests** measured by duration.
  4. **Possession**: Each must have a right to possession of the whole. After the joint tenancy is created, one joint tenant can voluntarily give exclusive possession to another.
- If any unity is lacking, a tenancy in common is created.
- If any unities are later severed, the joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common. Any one joint tenant can unilaterally convert a joint tenancy into a tenancy in common by conveying his interest to a third party.


##### Tenancy by the Entirety
- Created only by Husband & Wife
- Neither spouse can unilaterally act alone must act as marital unit
- Cannot exit unilaterally
  - Can end by both spouses to end
  - Divorce
- Requires Four Unities plus **Marriage**
- Exists in less than half of states


##### Community Property
- Some states of the South and west, especially those that have Spanish or French law in their early histories, have community property for married couples.
- Under community property, all property acquired during the marriage (except in some states for gifts and bequests to one spouse) automatically become community property.
- Each spouse has a right to possess community property, but typically any alienation or encumbrance must have the consent of both spouses.

#### Conflicts in Cocurrent Ownership
- Law will generally not intervene in Cocurrent ownership disputes or use Doctrine of Waste to rectify issues
- **Partition** as a **general remedy** - Automatic Right
  - Governed by Contract or Norms

#### Partition
- Legal remedy available to concurrent owners of property
- **Partition in Kind** = Physically Partitioning up land between co-owners
- **Parition in Sale** = Selling of the land and distributing the proceeds of sale to owners proportionally.

##### Partition in Kind
- Divides up property and gives shares to each
- Partition in kind should take priority over a partition sale.
  - Generally favored UNLESS:
    - Doing so is **impractical**
    - Sale would be better **serve the owners interests**
      - See *[Delfino v. Vealencis](link)*

##### Partition in Sale
- Selling property at auction and dividing proceeds
- Increased trend toward partition in sale

##### Problem on Partition in Kind (Subjective v. Objective Value)
- A and B are heirs of their father, who owned one item both A and B very much want—his old rocking chair. They cannot agree who is to have the chair. A brings a partition action. What relief should the court award?
- A and B own the chair as tenants in common. The chair cannot be partitioned in kind, so there must be a partition sale. Both attach equal value to the chair, so the one with more money will probably get it by paying more for it.




#### Contribution & Accounting
- An ousted cotenant may recover her share of rents and profits from land held jointly or in common.
  - A cotenant not in possession is liable for his share of necessary repairs or maintenance costs.
- **Ouster**: Ouster occurs when one cotenant acts in a way that “necessarily excludes” another cotenant by necessarily depriving her of the free and unobstructed use and possession of the common property. Sole use of the entire property, in and of itself, does not constitute ouster.
- Basic rules of in possession:
  - Usually if a cotenant makes a unilateral improvement to the property without consulting the other party, that cotenant cannot demand that the other cotenants pay for that improvement to the property.
  - Cotenant who makes repairs without consent of other cotenants is responsible to pay for repair or improvement.
    - Exceptions:
      - Acted in good faith that they were the only owner.
        - [Similar to Law of Mistaken Improvers](link)
      - Estoppel - Cotenant out of possession who knew what was going on is estopped from not paying;
      - When the repairs are **necessary to preserve or protect property**.
        - Variance: When co-tenant out of possession sues for ouster and an accounting takes place, Net damages may take place to streamline transactions.
- See *[Gillmor v. Gillmor](link)*
  - Co Tenant owes damages for ouster
  - Expenses were reasonable
  - Expense was necessary
- **Accounting as part of the partition**:
  - A partition will often be accompanied by an accounting.
    - In an accounting, one or more of the co-tenants may be charged for rents and profits, waste, allocable costs of repairs and improvements, taxes, etc.



#### Severance
- Severance converts a joint tenancy into a tenancy in common. Doesn’t cause separate ownership. Traditionally done in common law by severing one of the four unities.
- Either joint teneant can unilaterally "sever" the joint tenancy, which destroys the right of survivorship and converts the tenancy **into a tenancy in common**
- Joint Tenancy -Severance-> Tenancy in Common -Partition-> Separate Fees
  - Or Joint Tenancy -Partition-> Separate Fees
- Mortages do not sever joint tenancies because they **do not destroy unity of title**.
  - See *[Harms v. Sprague](link)*
    - The main issue was whether John Sprague’s mortgage of his interest severed the joint tenancy. A secondary issue was whether the mortgage survived John Harms’s death as a lien on the property.
      - A joint tenancy is not severed when one joint tenant executes a mortgage on his interest in the property, since the unity of title is preserved.
      - The mortgage did not survive, because it rested on John Harms’s interest, which expired at his death.
      - Had William died lien would not be secured by subsequent acquired property unless it had a clause.
      - Leasing property out to someone else would sometimes sever joint tenancy
      - Murder always severs joint tenancy
    - Problem with Joint Tenancy
      - Unilateral severance respects each co-owner’s rights by allowing each to control how his share is used. However, unilateral severance creates opportunities for fraud.
        - For instance, one tenant could secretly sever the joint tenancy by conveying his interest to a third party; but if the other joint tenant dies first, the survivor destroys the secret deed and claims sole title.
