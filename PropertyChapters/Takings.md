## Takings
- Federal, state, and local governments have the inherent power to take private property for public use over the owner’s objection, through a process known as eminent domain.
  - Takings power is limited both by statute & Constitution(s).
    - 5th Amendment  = Nor shall private property be taken **for public use** without **just compensation**.
    - 14th Amendment = incorporated to make binding on states by 1897
      - See *[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy RR.](link)*

### ...For Public Use...
- Historically interpreted as for actual public use
  - Eventually public use became public usefulness
  - Large deference given to legislature


#### Eminent Domain
- Eminent domain is the power of government to force transfers of property from owners to itself.
- Property Markets are **Thin Markets**
  - Property is not fungible and limited supply
  - Results in Holdout Problems when building projects
    - Strategic
    - Personal
- Rationals
  - Sovereign states had original and absolute ownership of property, prior to private ownership.
  - Royal prerogative in feudal times
  - Eminent domain is an inherent attribute of sovereignty.
- Why Compensate?
  - Moral imperative
  - Guard the propertied classes against redistribution of wealth

#### The Public-Use Puzzle
- The Takings Clause limits eminent domain to “public use.” What counts as public use?

##### Economic Development as “Public Use”
- Economic development is a “public use.”
  - Public use = Public Purpose
  - 2 burdens for Eminent Domain:
    - That the takings of the particular properties at issue were “reasonably necessary” to achieve the City’s intended public use; & That the takings were for “reasonably foreseeable needs.”
  - Not everyone in the public must benefit for it to be a public use, e.g. a school is not used by everyone but benefits the public. Public purpose can’t be pretextual.
  - See *[Kelo v. City of New London](link)*
    - Exercise of eminent domain power for “public use” will be constitutional so long as it is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose.
    - O'Connor Dissent: Slippery Slope; No Affirmative Harm unlike Midkiff & Berman.
      - Lack of economic opportunity != harm?
    - Rational Basis for Takings
      - See *[Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff](link)*
        - The Court upheld a taking to reduce the concentration of land ownership.
    - Eminent domain laws in DC were upheld to get rid of urban blight.
      - See *[Berman v. Parker](link)*
        - The Court upheld a redevelopment plan for a blighted area, over the objection of the owner of a store that was not blighted, because the area “must be planned as a whole.

###### Post Kelo
  - States began ammending their constitutions to prevent takings allowed in Kelo
    - SCOTUS only created a low threshold in KELO, a constitutional minimum, & states can regulate the threshold to make it more difficult to assert Eminent Domain.


#### Modern Takings
- It only needs to be impending blight. If a reasonable person could conclude the area was blighted the government can take it.
  - See [Goldstein v. New York Urban Development Corporation](link)
    - Eminent Domain is ok if blighted; if any reasonable person would agree that this was blighted, then it is ok;
      - Whether the bar is too low, is for legislature to decide, because it requires weighing Public v. Private Interests.
    - Dissent: So much deference and they are referring to the legislature to determine if the legislature is allowed to do things.
      - The whole point in the takings clause requirements is to stop the legislature from taking anything they want to.
      - Removing blight was not the main reason for this project so there is pretext.
      - The community looked fine some buildings weren’t in good condition but that’s because he owners anticipated the taking so they weren’t going to invest in fixing them if they were going to be demolished anyway.
    - Condemnation Blight - 50% Vacancy = Blight?

- The judiciary may not overturn a finding of blight in an eminent-domain case, unless the legislative body’s decision is irrational or baseless.
- Rejected eminent domain takings based on **underutilization**
  - What is the optimal amount of underutilization to equal blight
  - What constitutes blight? = Nobody knows
    - Confirmation Bias of Blight used as a justification for takings
      - See [In Re Kaur, In Re Truck Away Inc.](link)

##### Summary of Takings between Goldstein & Kaur
  - Facts of two above cases are similar and yet two courts and two judges reaching separate opinions


#### Just Compensation

#####  Owners of taken land get pre-dev price, not post-dev price.
- Compensation is for owner’s loss, not taker’s gain
- General Rule is that the fair market value for the taking is from the date of the taking. Here, it depended on the government’s intent and when the government becomes committed to the project is the date the fair market value is evaluated. If their intent was taking the property in question then the date of the commitment is the date of fair market value evaluatin, however, if the original scope of the project (when they committed to it) did not include the parcel in question then it is measured buy the date of the actual taking.

### Regulatory Takings
#### NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard)
- If the regulation is just an exercise of the 10th Amendment police power then no, govt does not have to provide compensation, But, if it amounts to a regulatory taking, then government must provide just compensation, even though government does not physically occupy the land.
  - See *[US v. Miller](link)*

##### It is a per se taking if the regulation authorizes a permanent physical occupation of property
  - See *[Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp](link)*
