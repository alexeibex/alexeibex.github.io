## Takings
- Federal, state, and local governments have the inherent power to take private property for public use over the owner’s objection, through a process known as eminent domain.
  - Takings power is limited both by statute & Constitution(s).
    - 5th Amendment  = Nor shall private property be taken **for public use** without **just compensation**.
    - 14th Amendment = incorporated to make binding on states by 1897
      - See *[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy RR.](link)*

### ...For Public Use...
- Historically interpreted as for actual public use
  - Eventually public use became public usefulness
  - Large deference given to legislature


#### Eminent Domain
- Eminent domain is the power of government to force transfers of property from owners to itself.
- Property Markets are **Thin Markets**
  - Property is not fungible and limited supply
  - Results in Holdout Problems when building projects
    - Strategic
    - Personal
- Rationals
  - Sovereign states had original and absolute ownership of property, prior to private ownership.
  - Royal prerogative in feudal times
  - Eminent domain is an inherent attribute of sovereignty.
- Why Compensate?
  - Moral imperative
  - Guard the propertied classes against redistribution of wealth

#### The Public-Use Puzzle
- The Takings Clause limits eminent domain to “public use.” What counts as public use?

##### Economic Development as “Public Use”
- Economic development is a “public use.”
  - Public use = Public Purpose
  - 2 burdens for Eminent Domain:
    - That the takings of the particular properties at issue were “reasonably necessary” to achieve the City’s intended public use; & - That the takings were for “reasonably foreseeable needs.”
  - Not everyone in the public must benefit for it to be a public use, e.g. a school is not used by everyone but benefits the public. Public purpose can’t be pretextual.
  - See *[Kelo v. City of New London](link)*
    - Exercise of eminent domain power for “public use” will be constitutional so long as it is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose.
    - Rational Basis for Takings
      - See *[Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff](link)*
        - The Court upheld a taking to reduce the concentration of land ownership.
    - Eminent domain laws in DC were upheld to get rid of urban blight.
      - See *[Berman v. Parker](link)*
        - The Court upheld a redevelopment plan for a blighted area, over the objection of the owner of a store that was not blighted, because the area “must be planned as a whole.
