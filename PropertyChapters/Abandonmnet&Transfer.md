### Transfer of Property
- Right to transfer enhances owner autonomy, permits owner to shed responsibility for things that no longer suit the owner’s wants or needs, and at same time to acquire other things that may be better suited to owner’s wants and needs. Policy Reasons for allowing these transfers:
  - **Autonomy enhancing**
    1. Allows owners to designate their Successors; inheritance. Inheritance keeps $ in hands of the same (although this also raises concerns, e.g. Hawaii land oligopolies in MIDRIFF).
  - Restrictions on alienation
    1. i.e. Absolute restrictions on alienation are void & can't be enforced.
      1. e.g. "X is not allowed to transfer property to Y on the condition that Y cannot transfer to anyone else."
    1. But some restrictions on alienation could be upheld.
      2. e.g. Statute of Frauds states that some contracts -- ie real estate --must be in writing. This is said to enhance transferability.


#### Statute of Frauds
- Designed to promote transferability requires that certain important transfers of property be memorialized by a writing.
- Any conveyance of a property right in land and any contract for the assignment, surrender, or sale of a property right in land must be in writing and signed by at least one of the parties
- POLICY: Applies to transfers of property rights in land, has increased overall security of property rights, and thus, has enabled transfers of property to occur more frequently and at lower cost


#### Types of Property Transfer (2 Types)
- **Exchanges** (quid pro quos) in which owner relinquishes title to some owned thing in exchange for a reciprocal transfer of some other thing.
- **Gifts** in which owner relinquishes title to some owned thing in favor of another person without explicitly receiving or expecting to receive something in return
  - What is a Gift?
    - A gift is a voluntary, immediate transfer of property without consideration from one person (the donor) to another person (the donee).
- 2 Categories of **gifts**:
  - Gift inter vivos
    - 3 Requirements:
      - Intent
        - Donor must intend to make an immediate transfer of ownership to the donee. The statements and actions of the donor usually provide the best evidence of intent. But if the donor intends the gift to take effect in the future, it is ineffective.
      - Delivery
      - Acceptance
  - Gift causa mortis.
    - See *[Foster v. Reiss](Link)*
      - Rule: A valid donation causa mortis requires:
        1. Donor makes the gift due to present illness;
        2. Donor dies after making gift.
          - If donor recovers, donor can revoke it & gift is nullified.
        3. Delivery of the gift.
          - Several contexts, law requires that a transfer take place only if the thing being transferred or some evidence of title is delivered to transferee
          - Deed must be “signed, sealed, and delivered” before the transaction is complete.
          - Law requires either a deed of gift or actual delivery of object given. Req of delivery is satisfied only by delivery by the donor, not by the mere taking of possession of the property by the donee.


#### Delivery Requirement For Real Property
  - See *[Gilbert v. McSpadden](Link)*
    - Delivery may be effected by any act or word manifesting an unequivocal intention to surrender the instrument so as to deprive the grantor of all authority over it or of the right of recalling it
    - If deed remains within grantor’s control and liable to be recalled, there is NO delivery!

#### Licenses
- LICENSES = an impermanent way that limits the right to exclude; not property.
  - Licenses are generally revocable.
  - Even if purchased, Licenses are still revocable.
  - But, Licenses, coupled with GRANTS/INTERESTS, are NOT revocable at will.
    - Doctrine of Estoppel
      - The license can become irrevocable when the license holder substantially & detrimentally relied). The court says that you are estopped from defeating your own grant.
    - See *[Wood v. Leadbitter](link)*
      - Contractual licenses may be revoked at any time.
- State of Law Today
  - Oral License for entry to property accepted today
  - Licenses are **revocable at anytime**
