## Covenants

### The Serene Fortress
- Americans increasingly live in gated communities, governed by private covenants.309

- Promises respecting the use of land
- The right to insist on the use or nonuse of land
- Covenants can either be affirmative or negative
- A real covenant is a promise concerning the use of land that benefits and burdens the original parties to the promise and sometimes their successors if the covenant runs with the land.
  - Purely Contractual
  - SOF applies; must be in writing.
  - There is NO covenant by necessity, by estoppel, by implication, etc.

- Two Types Real Convenant v. Equitable Servitude
  - Seeking Injunctive Relief = Equitable Servitude
  - Seeking Money Damages = Real Coneenants

- What Happens When Parties to Covenant Transfer/Sell Land to a Successor?
  - Do Covenants **Run** with the land?


#### Creation and Enforcement
- Examination of Benefit Run & Burden Run (Anazlyzed Separately)

- Scenario 1 (**Burden Run**) W-I-T-H-N
  - The original promisee (A) seeks to enforce a promise against the promisor’s successor (C). Does the burden **run**?
    - Must be in **writing**. (W)
    - Must show parties **intent for the burden to bind successors** (I)
      - Explicit
      - Inferred
    - Touch and Concern - Benefit in Gross (T)
      - Dependent on the context of community
      - Must show the covenant/servitude benefits the community as a whole AND improves the value of the land.
    - Horizontal & Vertical Privity (H)
      - **Horizontal Privity** - Successive interests: horizontal privity arises when the covenant is created from a transaction conveying land from A to B
        - e.g., A conveys one of his lots to B with a deed containing a covenant. This is the US majority rule.
      - **Vertical Privity **
        - Vertical privity is required for the burden to bind the promisor’s suc- cessors (here, D). It arises when the promisor conveys his entire estate, but not less than that (e.g., a life estate or term of years)
        - Complete Succession of Estate
    - Notice (N)
      - Successors must have notice (actual, record, inquiry, or imputed).
        - Record: Deed of Public Office
        - Inquiry: RPP would ask
      - Traditional Rule: No Notice required BUT!
        - Nemo Dat: Burdened Party cannot transfer a right from the bundle in which it gave away via covenant
          - Theoretically Cost of Burden would be taken into consideration when purchasing property from Burdened party
- Scenario 2 Equitable Servitudes T-W-I-N-[E-S]
  - Note:
    - Potentially No Writing Requirement
    - No Vertical or Horizontal Privity
