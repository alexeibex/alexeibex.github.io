## Covenants

### The Serene Fortress
- Americans increasingly live in gated communities, governed by private covenants.309

- Promises respecting the use of land
- The right to insist on the use or nonuse of land
- Covenants can either be affirmative or negative
- A real covenant is a promise concerning the use of land that benefits and burdens the original parties to the promise and sometimes their successors if the covenant runs with the land.
  - Purely Contractual
  - SOF applies; must be in writing.
  - There is NO covenant by necessity, by estoppel, by implication, etc.

- Two Types Real Convenant v. Equitable Servitude
  - Seeking Injunctive Relief = Equitable Servitude
  - Seeking Money Damages = Real Coneenants

- What Happens When Parties to Covenant Transfer/Sell Land to a Successor?
  - Do Covenants **Run** with the land?


#### Creation and Enforcement
- Examination of Benefit Run & Burden Run (Anazlyzed Separately)

- Scenario 1 (**Burden Run**) W-I-T-H-N
  - The original promisee (A) seeks to enforce a promise against the promisor’s successor (C). Does the burden **run**?
    - Must be in **writing**. (W)
    - Must show parties **intent for the burden to bind successors** (I)
      - Explicit
      - Inferred
    - Touch and Concern - Benefit in Gross (T)
      - Dependent on the context of community
      - Must show the covenant/servitude benefits the community as a whole AND improves the value of the land.
    - Horizontal & Vertical Privity (H)
      - **Horizontal Privity** - Successive interests: horizontal privity arises when the covenant is created from a transaction conveying land from A to B
        - e.g., A conveys one of his lots to B with a deed containing a covenant. This is the US majority rule.
      - **Vertical Privity **
        - Vertical privity is required for the burden to bind the promisor’s suc- cessors (here, D). It arises when the promisor conveys his entire estate, but not less than that (e.g., a life estate or term of years)
        - Complete Succession of Estate
    - Notice (N)
      - Successors must have notice (actual, record, inquiry, or imputed).
        - Record: Deed of Public Office
        - Inquiry: RPP would ask
      - Traditional Rule: No Notice required BUT!
        - Nemo Dat: Burdened Party cannot transfer a right from the bundle in which it gave away via covenant
          - Theoretically Cost of Burden would be taken into consideration when purchasing property from Burdened party
- Scenario 2 Equitable Servitudes T-W-I-N-[E-S]
  - Note:
    - Potentially No Writing Requirement
    - No Vertical or Horizontal Privity

#### Origin of Covenants
- The court here held that if the original covenant is to have any value, it must be enforceable against subsequent purchasers.
  - Era Prior to Zonining, Enforcing Covenants ensures that people will not be afraid to sell their property
  - Cost of Covenant was priced into purchasing price.
  - See *[Tulk v. Moxhay](Link)*
    - Does the burden run w/ the land?
      - Was the original agreement in writing?
        - Yes it was written into the deed.
      - Was it intended to make successor parties bound to the agreement?
        - Yes, b/c deed’s lang explicitly states " & his heirs & his assigns."
      - Does this covenant touch & concern the land?
        - Yes, b/c covenant controls what happens to the
      land.
      - Do we have vertical privity?
        - Yes, b/c there is no hostile nexus.
        - New burdened party purchased it from original
      owner.
     - Was there notice?
        - Yes, it was stipulated; the new burdened party admitted he knew about it.
     - Was there horizontal privity?
        - NO! No horizontal privity here, b/c under English law at this time, the only way to get Horizontal privity was between Lessor- Lessee which is not the case here! (today, this would not be an issue, because there’s Horizontal privity between grantor-grantee in sale)
     - Thus, this burden does not run w/ land.
   - Not an easement
     - Resembles Negative Easement but not within the 4 categofies of engative easements

- Touch and Concern Issues
  - Highly Depend
  - Does the covenant/Servitude benefit the community as a whole AND (so that it) improves the value of the land
    - See *[Neponsit Property Owners’ Association, Inc., v. Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank](Link)]


- Notice Requirements
  - Subdivsions
    - A subdivision developer wants to bind all lots to a covenant restricting use to residential purposes. He includes the covenant in each deed. But what if he forgets to include the covenant in some of the deeds? Can it still be enforced as an implied covenant?
      - A common scheme creates an implied reciprocal covenant that binds successors.
      - Reciprocal negative easement (but really, an implied reciprocal servitude)
      - Inquiry notice can be sufficient.
        - See *[Sanborn v. McClean](link)*

- Termination of Convenant or Servitude
  - Express Terms
  - Mergers: (e.g., the owner of the benefited land gains possession of the burdened land).
  - Release: the parties can agree on an expiration date or agree to release their rights. State statutes might also limit duration or require periodic re-recording
  - Perscription
  - Estoppel
  - Transfer to Bona Fide Purchaser
  - Changing Circumstances: the covenant becomes unenforceable when the benefits cannot be substantially realized without inequity.
    - Refusal to enforce deed restrictions (equitable servitude)
      - By reason of changed conditions, enforcement of the restrictions would be: **Must have all 3**
        1) inequitable, and
        2) would harass P,
        3) without benefitting the adjoining owners(Examine both Market Value & Benefit Receieved in Total); OR
      - When changed conditions in the neighborhood have rendered the purpose of the restrictions obsolete.
        - i.e. a P sues to prevent commercial construction, but that P has commercial buildings on their own lots.
    - See: *[Bolotin v. Ringe](Link)*
      - Policy of Changed Circumstances
        - Property lasts a long time as does property
        - Time & Necessities Change over time
        - No way to predict the future & Covenants inject inflexibilty in system
        - Holdout problems
  - Abandonment: The person entitled to the benefit demonstrates intent to abandon the covenant.
    - Abandonment of a covenant requires proof that prior violations have eroded the general plan, and enforcement is therefore inequitable. A covenant is abandoned when it has been habitually and substantially violated. But a few violations do not constitute abandonment.
    - Abandonment requires:
      1. Prior violations which eroded the general plan;
      2. Habitual and substantial violations (% of properties out of total violating covenant); and,
      3. Enforcement of covenant would be unequitable.
