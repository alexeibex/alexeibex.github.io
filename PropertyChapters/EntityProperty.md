## Entity Property
- In order to provide for a more effective means of of management of resources, the law has developed a governance strategy for the management of resources.
- Key attribute of entity property devices is that they permit the management of resources to be separated from their use and enjoyment.
  - Separation allows the managerial governance function to be concentrated in the hands of specialists, while the use and enjoyment is distributed over a larer and more diffuse group of individuals.

### Functional Categories
#### Possessory
- To separate management of a complex of assets from regular actual use of some protion of the assets by various persons or family units.
  - Leases
  - Cooperatives
  - Condominiums
#### Non Possessory
- Designed primarily to separate management of a complex of assets from the enjoyment of financial or other intangible returns for various persons or family units
  - Trusts
  - Corporations
  - Nonprofits
  - Partnerships

### Legal Categories
#### Functional Specialization
#### Property Rights

### Separating Management and Possessory Rights
#### Leases
- De Facto financing device
  - Arrangement in which the owner of the property lends possession to another in return for periodic payments of money called rent
- Leases operate asa risk spreading device for both landlord and tenant
- Leases operate as a mechanism for integrating and managing complexes of assets and in that sense function as a kind of entity property

##### Lease Types
- **Lease Themes:** The Allocation of Risk in Circumstances when there are asymetric information or control
- **Terms of years**
  - Lasts for a fixed term of years
  - Some States set upper limits
- **Periodic Tenancy**
  - Continues for succeeding periods until the tenant or landlord gives notice.
  - Common law rules required six months’ notice to terminate a year-to-year tenancy. For shorter periods, notice of termination must equal the period, or six months—whichever is less (i.e., the notice period cannot exceed six months).
- **Tenancy at Will**
  - No fixed period. It endures as long as the landlord and tenant want.
  - Some modern statutes have notice requirements.
- **Tenancy at Sufferance**
  - Arises when a tenant in possession remains in possession after termination of the tenancy.
  - At common law, landlords had two options: eviction or consent.
    - Cannot necessarily use self help
      - See *[Berg v. Wiley](link)*

##### Independent Covenants Model
-  Two independent covenants are entered into in a lease:
  - The tenant promises to pay rent in the lease; and the landlord granting the lease creates a covenant of private enjoyment the landlord will not interfere with the tenant’s possession.
  - The Landlord does not have to keep anyone else form interfering with the tenants use and enjoyment.
    - See *[Paradine v. Jane](link)*
      - Today, if someone leases residential property and the property is destroyed, the tenant is off the hook. However, if the lease is commercial, the tenant then may still be obliged to fulfill the terms of the lease.
- **Risk Allocation**: Tenant has more control over the profit & loss than landlord does.
  - Therefore, tenant should bear risk of loss.
    - Context: 1640 Era
- Leases can have a forfeiture clause that says violating one covenant means you lose all the covenants.
  - Including covenant of quiet enjoyment
- Moving away from Independent to Dependent Covnenants

##### Dependent Covenants
- Where the landlord interferes with a tenants right to private enjoyment, the tenant does not have to pay rent. The covenant to pay rent is dependent on the covenant of private enjoyment.
  - See *[Smith v. Mcenany](link)*
    - Encroachment, if more than de minimis [here 30’x9”], interferes w/ Tenant’s Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment.
    - Risk allocation = Landlord is in better position to know land's boundaries.
    - Asymmetry = There’s slight info asymmetry (b/c tenant could get a surveyor, but more landlord's responsibility).

##### Restrictive & Dependent Covenants
- Independent v. Dependent Covenants: Must examine Intent of Parties
- Shifting Risk from Tenant to Landlord
- Atenant’s obligation to pay rent is dependent on the land lord’s compliance with a restrictive covenant in the lease, if the landlord’s breach of the covenant will defeat the purpose of the lease.
  - 1. Both covenant to pay rent & covenant not to sell to others were included in a Rider.
  - 2. Plain language in the agreement
  - 3. It was obvious that the subject matter of the restrictive covenant was vital.
- Implicit **Material** Breach not minor
  - Major breaches lead to convenants that are treated as dependent; minor breaches treated as independent
- Three possible remedies for dependent covenants:
  - 1. Rescind the lease;
  - 2. Stay in the building but sue for profits lost;
  - 3. Leave the lease and sue for damages for before they left.
- Tenants cannot get out of a lease for a minor violation, they can only sue for damages. Look at the intent of the party to determine If it was intended to be independent or dependent.
  - See *[Medico-Dental Building Company of Los Angeles v. Horton & Converse](Link)*

##### Caveat Lessee
- “Caveat Lessee” = tenant beware.
  - There is an implied warranty that the leased premises will be fit for the tenant’s intended purposes.
- A tenant must pay rent for land that is unfit for the tenant’s purposes if the purposes are not described in the lease, because there is no implied warranty that leased land will be fit for the tenant’s purposes.
  - Tenant is more capable of determining that property is beneficial and useful for their intended purposes
    - See *[Sutton v. Temple](Link)*
      - If a person enters a lease for the use and occupation of land for a specific purpose, he is bound to that bargain, even though he took it for a particular purpose and that purpose was unattainable.
- Harsh Doctrine because it can be potentially burdensom
  - Courts have created doctrines for mitigation of Caveat Lessee (Risk Mitigation)
    - See *[Blackett v. Olanoff](link)*
      - General Rule for **Constructive Eviction**:
        - 1. Someone’s conduct substantially interfered with tenants use and enjoyment of the property, AND
        - 2. The landlord can somehow be responsible.
      - (Most jurisdictions, if claiming constructive eviction, you actually have to leave the property).
      - A tenants implied covenant or quiet enjoyment is violated where the lease gives the landlord control over the noise level of the tenant and does nothing to prevent the disturbance.
      - **Tenant’s Implied Warranty of Quiet Enjoyment**

##### Surrender
- When Tenant/lessee attempts to repudiate/refuse a lease prior to expiration, landlord has 3 options:
  - Landlord may reject T's repudiation & do nothing.
    - If L does so, T continues to remain liable under the lease terms.
  - Lessor can reject T's repudiation, enter premises & re-let the premises as T’s agent for T’s own benefit. In this case, T remains liable for any rent deficiency.
    - T1 is also liable for full rent during period it takes for L to find new T2, + any reasonable expenditures in finding a new T2 (e.g. cost of ads).
  - Lessor also has option to accept T's repudiation, re-enter premises & re-let for L’s own benefit. In that event, Tis generally relieved from any further liability under lease. No further rent accrues b/c L-T relationship no longer exists.
    - If this option occurs, the tenant owes nothing & is out of the Lease. All $ coming in will go straight to the L.
- Termination & Surrender by Express/Operation of Law  (Acceptance of Repudiation)
  - By express agreement.
  - By operation of law – when it’s inferred to be rejected by implication based on the parties’ conduct.
    - A landlord accepts its tenant’s repudiation of a lease when the landlord sends a new tenant a proposed lease.
      - Do some act so inconsistent with relationship which implies “their intent to deem the lease terminated.”
        - An outward refusal to accept repudiation of lease does not bar a finding that the parties’ subsequent conduct creates an acceptance by operation of law.
      - Mere attempts to re-let premises are insufficient to est an acceptance by operation of law.
        - Detail and degree of Ps’ actions (written offer to Rite-Aid for their sole benefit) went above “mere attempts.”
        - Payment of lesser amounts of rent, delivery of keys not enough under lease here
  - Once repudiation is accepted, then former Ts liable for the full amount of rent owed up to the moment of acceptance, BUT IS OFF THE HOOK THEREAFTER.
  - See *[Gottlieb v. Taco Bell](Link)*

##### Abandonmnent
- The modern trend is to require landlords to mitigate by finding a new tenant, but at common law there was no duty to mitigate.
- The landlord should “treat the apartment in question as if it was one of his vacant stock.
  - Relevant factors include advertising, showing to potential tenants, and rent relative to comparable properties.
    - There is an increasing trend to treat leases not as conveyances of land, but as contracts. As a result, application of the contract doctrine of mitigation of damages is appropriate. If a landlord fails to mitigate damages when he has the opportunity, the defaulting tenant may be relieved of his duty to pay rent.
    - Not a loss volume seller because each apartment may have unique features.
      - *[Sommer v. Kridel](link)*

##### Hypo
1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |  5 | 6
--|---|---|---|---|--
T1 Vacates  |   | L Relets @ $700   |   |   |  Lease of T1 Ends

###### 3 Months after L Relets
1. If Court determines surrender has been accepted T1 owes = $o
2. If Court determines reletting not an acceptance of surrender they owe $900 ($300 x 3 Months)

###### 3 Months Prior to Reletting
- No duty to mitigate, per lease agreement T1 owes = $3000 ($1000 x 3 months)
- Duty to mitigate (1 Month is Reasonable time to Relet)
  - $1000 for 1st month +
  - $100 expense for transaction costs +
  - + FMV of new lease($700) for months 2 & 3
    - Duty to mitigate != Duty to excuse lease

#### Implied Warranty of Habitability
- The landlord must repair the premises regardless of the provisions of the lease.
- Creates a dependent covenant - Treat lease agreements as an ordinary contract
  - If the landlord breaches warranty of habitability, then the tenant can stop paying rent
- A breach occurs when **a reasonable person** would find the **premises uninhabitable** or when the property **violates housing codes**.
- **Cannot be waived**
- In regards to residential property, the landlord makes an implied warranty of habitability and that standard of habitability is set by relevant housing codes.
  - Modern Status of Renting
    - Most renters acquire living space in a building, not farmland.
    - Apartment buildings are complex, making them difficult to inspect and repair.
    - Renters are also unlikely to be able to make home repairs themselves
    - Modern tenants frequently move so unable to internalize the full benefits of repairs v. landlord who can relet property at higher price post repairs.
  - Consumer Protection
    - Info asymmetry; unequal bargaining power because of standardized forms where all Landlords are offering the same terms.
  - Poor Quality Housing is the detriment to the entire city
  - See *[Javins v. 1st National Realty Corp.](Link)*

##### Remedies for Tenants
- Remain in Possession and Withhold Rent
  - The landlord cannot sue for unpaid rent or to evict, since the tenant can raise the defense of the breach of the implied warranty.
- Remain in possession and “repair and deduct”
- Remain in possession, pay rent, and sue for damages
- Terminate lease and sue for damages

##### Policy Reasons
  - **Caveat lessee** does not suit the needs of poor urban tenants. Urban tenants lack the skills to repair the premises on their own, and the shortage of affordable housing makes it unlikely that they will be able to negotiate with landlords.
