## Entity Property
- In order to provide for a more effective means of of management of resources, the law has developed a governance strategy for the management of resources.
- Key attribute of entity property devices is that they permit the management of resources to be separated from their use and enjoyment.
  - Separation allows the managerial governance function to be concentrated in the hands of specialists, while the use and enjoyment is distributed over a larer and more diffuse group of individuals.

- De Facto financing device
  - Arrangement in which the owner of the property lends possession to another in return for periodic payments of money called rent
- Leases operate asa risk spreading device for both landlord and tenant
- Leases operate as a mechanism for integrating and managing complexes of assets and in that sense function as a kind of entity property

##### Lease Types
- **Lease Themes:** The Allocation of Risk in Circumstances when there are asymetric information or control
- **Terms of years**
  - Lasts for a fixed term of years
  - Some States set upper limits
- **Periodic Tenancy**
  - Continues for succeeding periods until the tenant or landlord gives notice.
  - Common law rules required six months’ notice to terminate a year-to-year tenancy. For shorter periods, notice of termination must equal the period, or six months—whichever is less (i.e., the notice period cannot exceed six months).
- **Tenancy at Will**
  - No fixed period. It endures as long as the landlord and tenant want.
  - Some modern statutes have notice requirements.
- **Tenancy at Sufferance**
  - Arises when a tenant in possession remains in possession after termination of the tenancy.
  - At common law, landlords had two options: eviction or consent.
    - Cannot necessarily use self help
      - See *[Berg v. Wiley](link)*

##### Independent Covenants Model
-  Two independent covenants are entered into in a lease:
  - The tenant promises to pay rent in the lease; and the landlord granting the lease creates a covenant of private enjoyment the landlord will not interfere with the tenant’s possession.
  - The Landlord does not have to keep anyone else form interfering with the tenants use and enjoyment.
    - See *[Paradine v. Jane](link)*
      - Today, if someone leases residential property and the property is destroyed, the tenant is off the hook. However, if the lease is commercial, the tenant then may still be obliged to fulfill the terms of the lease.
- **Risk Allocation**: Tenant has more control over the profit & loss than landlord does.
  - Therefore, tenant should bear risk of loss.
    - Context: 1640 Era
- Leases can have a forfeiture clause that says violating one covenant means you lose all the covenants.
  - Including covenant of quiet enjoyment
- Moving away fro Independent to Dependent Covnenants
