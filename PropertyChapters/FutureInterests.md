# Forms of Ownership Across Persons and Time
- Terms enable people to divide property over persons and time
  - Lanaguge used for that purpose only, not descriptive
- **Estate**: Property Rights Divided up Through Time
- Divide Property (Bundle of Rights) Across Time
  - Property lasts forever
  - Any time an asset is shared among multiple owners, a collective action problem is created, which can be seen as a kind of miniature “tragedy of the commons”


## Interests



Present Possession| Future Interests (Revisionary to Original Owner)  |  Future Interests (To Other People)
--|---|--
Fee Simple Absolute  | N/A (end of time) |  N/A (end of time)
Life Estate  | Reversion  |  Remainder
Fee Simple Determinable  |  Possibility of Reverter |  N/A
Fee Simple Subject to A Condition Subsequent  | Right of Entry/Power of Termination  |  N/A
Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation  |  N/A | Executory Interests



### Present Possessory
- Allow for possession of the property **Now**


##### Fee/Fees Simple Absolute
- Presumed Transfer of Property
- Largest Bundle of Sticks (Rights)
- Granted until *end of universe*
  - Express Language
    - "**To Jones**" = Fee Simple Absolute
    - "**To Jones and His Heirs**" = Fee Simple Absolute
      - The “heirs” **have no legal right** to the property here! “And her heirs” are just words to show that it is a fee simple absolute. (note: “Heirs” can only be determined at time of death; “Heirs Apparent” are the ppl who look like they’ll going to be the only heirs while Jessie is alive).

##### Life Estate
- A freehold estate whose duration is measured by the lives of one or more specified persons.
  - Lasts only for the life of the natural owner—does not go to infinity
  - "Pur Autre Vie" = Duration may be measured by the life of a person other than the Grantee.
  - Language used to create: Grant “to A for A’s life” creates a life estate in A, for as long as he lives. “to A for B’s life”)

#### Defeasible Fees
- Allows for ownership to change if contingent event occurs
- No defined end but usually time limit placed on contingent event
- Contingent Event Results:
  - Who gets the property
  - Automatic or Exercised via Option
##### 1. Fee Simple Determinable
  - Using **Durational** Language - "*until*", "*as long as*"
  - Automatic execution per language
##### 2. Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent
  - Using **Conditional** Language - "*but if*", "*if*", *"but"*
  - Original Grantor can **Choose** to execute
##### 3. Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation
  - If event occurs, right goes to **3rd party** not grantor
  - Using **Durational** or **Conditional** Language
  - Seems to work automatically


### Future Interests
- By Operation of Law, Implicitly always someone to take the property if otherwise seen as unowned.

#### Reversion

#### Possibility of Reverter
- Adverse Possession Issue as soon as Reverter Occurs

#### Right of Entry/Power of Termination
- Gives grantor a "Right of Entry" to be executed
  - Laches may bar exercising of right if not done in timely fashion

#### Life Estate = Remainder
- "To A for life, then to B"
  - B has a remainder

#### Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitiation = Executory Interests
- Shifting and Springing
  - Shifting: Cuts short the interests other than the original grantor. A sets condition that cuts short B's interest and gives to C.
  - Springing: Cuts short the interest of the grantor


#### Hypos

##### O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to B and his heirs”**
  1. Present Possessory Interest
  2. A has a Life Estate.
  3. Future Interest
  4. B has an Indefeasibly Vested Remainder in Fee Simple
- Only 2 types of interests can follow a Life Estate—Reversion or Remainder.
- Here, future interest is a Remainder because it is not going back to O.
  - The Remainder is Vested because there are no contingencies (we know who B is).
- It is Indefeasibly Vested because it cannot be taken away.


##### Same as 1. But, C enters adversely. 30 years later, C is still on Blackacre and A, still alive, has nver entered.**
  1. Present Possessory Interest
  1. A had a Life Estate initially, but A no longer has any ownership interest.
- Future Interest
  1. C took A’s life estate through his AP. Thus, C now has a Life Estate Pur Autre vie in A.
    - B/c of C’s AP, A lost his ownership interest.
    - But, one cannot possess more than what one owns; b/c of Nemo Dat, C cannot adversely possess more than the ownership interest of A. Thus, B still has his FI.
- C will only have the Life Estate for as long as A is alive. - B has a Remainder in Fee Simple Absolute.
- B can claim it after A dies, even though C now owns it through AP!

##### O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to B and her heirs; but if B ever remarries, then to C and her
heirs”
  1. Present Possessory Interest
    - A has Life Estate.
  2. Future Interest
- B has a Vested Remainder in Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation.
- C has a (Shifting) Executory Interest.


##### O conveys Blackacre “to A for life, then to B for life, then to C”
  1. Present Possessory Interest
     - A has Life Estate.
  2. Future Interest
    - B has Indefeasibly Vested Remainder in Life Estate.
    - C has Indefeasibly Vested Remainder in Fee Simple Absolute.

##### O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to B for life, then B’s children who survive him”
  1. Present Possessory Interest
    - A has Life Estate
  2. Future Interest
    - B has Indefeasibly Remainder for Life Estate. b. B’s children have:
      - If B has children at his death:
        - Remainder in Fee Simple.
    - If B never has children:
        - O has Implied Reversion.
        - *Remember that there must always be someone who can take!*

---

### Remainders
- Future interest created in a Grantee that follows a Life Estate
- A remainder is “a future interest that waits politely until the termination of the preceding possessory estate, at which time the remainder moves into possession if it is then vested.

#### Waste
##### 3 Types of Waste

###### **1. Affirmative Waste**
- Misfeasence
- When Life Tenant undertakes an Affirmative act on the property that is unreasonable and causes excess damage

###### **2. Permissive Waste**
- Nonfeasence
- Unreasonable failure to act that causes excess damage to the reversionary or remainder interest


###### **3. Ameliorative Waste**
- Occurs when Life Tenant significantly changes the property, but causes an increase--not decrease--in the market value.
- Traditional Rule re Ameliorative Waste (minority view today):
  - Life Tenant may only use property reasonably for his own convenience/ profit.
  - Any act by Life Tenant which does permanent injury to inheritance is “waste.”
    - See *[Brokow v. Fairchild](link)*
      - A life tenant may not use his land in a manner that causes permanent injury to the inheritance.
      - This is a minority opinion. Most jurisdictions have evolved the rule to allow things that maxminize the value of the property. Not enough to increase value of the property it needs to maximize it to be allowable.

#### Restraints on Alienation
1. The rule against direct restraints on alienation dates to at least the fifteenth century.
2. There are four justifications:
  - Restraints make property unmarketable, which may prevent it from being put to good use.
  - Restraints perpetuate concentrations of wealth.
  - Restraints discourage improvements on land.
  - Restraints prevent owners’ creditors from accessing the land.


- **Disabling**: a grantee cannot transfer his interest.
- **Forfeiture**: a grantee loses his interest if he attempts to transfer it.
- **Promissory**: a grantee promises not to transfer his interest. Enforceable through contract remedies.
  - A use restriction creates a valid FSSCS even if it effectively creates an absolute restraint on alienation.
  - See *[Mountain Brow Lodge v. Toscano.](link)*
    - A use restriction creates a valid FSSCS (Fee Simple Subject to A Condition Subsequent) even if it effectively creates an absolute restraint on alienation.
    - The dissent argued that the use restriction, which only allowed I.O.O.F. Lodge No. 82 to use the land, was effectively identical to a restraint on alienation and should have been held void.


#### Concurrent Ownership
- A present estate in real or personal property can be simultaneously owned by 2+ persons, each holding the right to concurrent possession. This reflects the notion that ownership has divisions in 2 dimensions:
  - Horizontal Divisions (over time)
  - Vertical Divisions (at any given moment in time).
- 4 basic types of concurrent estates:
  - **Tenants in common**
  - **Joint tenants**
  - Tenancy by the entirety
  - Community property

##### Tenancy in Common
- Separate but undivided interest
  - Example: O conveys property to A and B
    - Modern Rule: Presumed by Default
  - Separately Alienable
  - The interest of each is descendable and may be conveyed by deed or will.
  - No survivorship rights: i.e., the interests are distinct even if one owner dies.
  - No Rights against one another
  - Each tenant owns an undivided share of the whole.
    - Can be equal OR unequal

##### Joint Tenancy
- Regarded as a single owner
- Both have a **right of survivorship** — so if one dies, that tenant’s interest is simply extinguished.
- Four **unities** are required:
  1. **Time**: All interests must be acquired simultaneously.
  2. **Title**: All interests must be acquired by the **same instrument** or by joint adverse possession.
  3. **Interest**: All must have **equal** undivided shares and **identical interests** measured by duration.
  4. **Possession**: Each must have a right to possession of the whole. After the joint tenancy is created, one joint tenant can voluntarily give exclusive possession to another.
- If any unity is lacking, a tenancy in common is created.
- If any unities are later severed, the joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common. Any one joint tenant can unilaterally convert a joint tenancy into a tenancy in common by conveying his interest to a third party.


##### Tenancy by the Entirety
- Created only by Husband & Wife
- Neither spouse can unilaterally act alone must act as marital unit
- Cannot exit unilaterally
  - Can end by both spouses to end
  - Divorce
- Requires Four Unities plus **Marriage**
- Exists in less than half of states


##### Community Property
- Some states of the South and west, especially those that have Spanish or French law in their early histories, have community property for married couples.
- Under community property, all property acquired during the marriage (except in some states for gifts and bequests to one spouse) automatically become community property.
- Each spouse has a right to possess community property, but typically any alienation or encumbrance must have the consent of both spouses.

#### Conflicts in Cocurrent Ownership
- Law will generally not intervene in Cocurrent ownership disputes.
- **Partition** as a general remedy - Automatic Right
  - Governed by Contract or Norms
  -
