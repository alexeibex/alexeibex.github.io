# Forms of Ownership Across Persons and Time
- Terms enable people to divide property over persons and time
  - Lanaguge used for that purpose only, not descriptive
- **Estate**: Property Rights Divided up Through Time
- Divide Property (Bundle of Rights) Across Time
  - Property lasts forever
  - Any time an asset is shared among multiple owners, a collective action problem is created, which can be seen as a kind of miniature “tragedy of the commons”


## Interests



Present Possession| Future Interests (Revisionary to Original Owner)  |  Future Interests (To Other People)
--|---|--
Fee Simple Absolute  | N/A (end of time) |  N/A (end of time)
Life Estate  | Reversion  |  Remainder
Fee Simple Determinable  |  Possibility of Reverter |  N/A
Fee Simple Subject to A Condition Subsequent  | Right of Entry/Power of Termination  |  N/A
Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation  |  N/A | Executory Interests



### Present Possessory
- Allow for possession of the property **Now**


##### Fee/Fees Simple Absolute
- Presumed Transfer of Property
- Largest Bundle of Sticks (Rights)
- Granted until *end of universe*
  - Express Language
    - "**To Jones**" = Fee Simple Absolute
    - "**To Jones and His Heirs**" = Fee Simple Absolute
      - The “heirs” **have no legal right** to the property here! “And her heirs” are just words to show that it is a fee simple absolute. (note: “Heirs” can only be determined at time of death; “Heirs Apparent” are the ppl who look like they’ll going to be the only heirs while Jessie is alive).

##### Life Estate
- A freehold estate whose duration is measured by the lives of one or more specified persons.
  - Lasts only for the life of the natural owner—does not go to infinity
  - "Pur Autre Vie" = Duration may be measured by the life of a person other than the Grantee.
  - Language used to create: Grant “to A for A’s life” creates a life estate in A, for as long as he lives. “to A for B’s life”)

#### Defeasible Fees
- Allows for ownership to change if contingent event occurs
- No defined end but usually time limit placed on contingent event
- Contingent Event Results:
  - Who gets the property
  - Automatic or Exercised via Option
##### 1. Fee Simple Determinable
  - Using **Durational** Language - "*until*", "*as long as*"
  - Automatic execution per language
##### 2. Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent
  - Using **Conditional** Language - "*but if*", "*if*", *"but"*
  - Original Grantor can **Choose** to execute
##### 3. Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation
  - If event occurs, right goes to **3rd party** not grantor
  - Using **Durational** or **Conditional** Language
  - Seems to work automatically


### Future Interests
- By Operation of Law, Implicitly always someone to take the property if otherwise seen as unowned.

#### Reversion


#### Possibility of Reverter
- Adverse Possession Issue as soon as Reverter Occurs

#### Right of Entry/Power of Termination
- Gives grantor a "Right of Entry" to be executed
  - Laches may bar exercising of right if not done in timely fashion

#### Life Estate = Remainder
- "To A for life, then to B"
  - B has a remainder

#### Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitiation = Executory Interests
- Shifting and Springing
  - Shifting: Cuts short the interests other than the original grantor. A sets condition that cuts short B's interest and gives to C.
  - Springing: Cuts short the interest of the grantor
