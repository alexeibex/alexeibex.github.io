## Easements & Covenants

#### Introduction
- Easements are a grant of an interest in another's land that entitles someone to **use** the land possessed by another.
- Easements typically "run with the land" (Apply to successive owners of property)
- Must be in writing (Statute of Frauds)
- Creation by Grant or Reservation
  - Example: Selling of "Bundle" MINUS one stick (access/easement)
- Cannot be used for adverse possession, no hostility
- Types of Easements
  - Affirmative
    - Owner of an affirmative easement (positive easement) has a right to go onto the land of another and do some act on the land
  - Negative
    - Owner of a negative easement can prevent the owner of the servient land from doing some act on the servient land.
- Easements appurtenant or in gross
  - All easements are either **appurtenant** to other land or **in gross**
    - Easements Appurtenant
      - Belong to another parcel of land - (right to travel across another's land to access road)
        - Access across parcel A (Servient) is appurtenant to Parcel B (Dominant)
      - If an easement benefits its owner in the use of another tract of land, it is appurtenant to that land. The land benefited is called the dominant tenement, the land burdended is the servient tenement. The servient tenement usually is, but does not have to be adjacent to the dominant tenant.
      - Ownership of easement transfers along with Dominant Parcel Ownership = Owners are **Tenants**
      - Easements = Servient/Dominant Estates
    - Easement in Gross
      - Stays with the grantee not with the owner of the Dominant Parcel, only sometimes transferrable depends on nature of easement.
        - Most courts will not recognize **recreational** easements in gross.
      - If an easement does not benefit its owner in the use and enjoyment of his land, but merely gives him the right to use the servient land, the easement is in gross.
      - "In Gross" is the term used to signify that benefit of the easement is not appurtenant to other land.
      - Not revocable like licenses
        - See *[Baseball Publishing Co. v. Bruton](link)*
    - Distinguishing Easements
      - Determined by the **Intent of the Parties**
        - Courts will examine circumstances of creation = Does this add to the use and enjoyment of the neighboring land (appurtenant) or not (in gross)
        - Generally lean toward appurtenant easements if difficult


#### Creation of Easements
- Easement in Gross created by Grant
  - Does not benefit the owner in the use and enjoyment of his land, but merely gives him a right to use the servient land, easement is in Gross
    - See *[Baseball Publishing Co. v. Bruton](link)*
- Easement Created by Necessity/Implied Easement
  - Requirements:
    - Must have been 1 common owner of all the plots
    - Owner must have chopped the property into different parcels
    - The parcel in question is landlocked.
