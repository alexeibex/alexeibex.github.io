## Easements
#### Introduction
- Easements are a grant of an interest in another's land that entitles someone to **use** the land possessed by another.
- Types of Easements
  - Affirmative
    - Owner of an affirmative easement (positive easement) has a right to go onto the land of another and do some act on the land
  - Negative
    - Owner of a negative easement can prevent the owner of the servient land from doing some act on the servient land.
- Easements appurtenant or in gross
  - All easements are either appurtenant to other land or in gross
    - Easements Appurtenant
      - If an easement benefits its owner in the use of another tract of land, it is appurtenant to that land. The land benefited is called the dominant tenement, the land burdended is the servient tenement. The servient tenement usually is, but does not have to be adjacent to the dominant tenant.
    - Easement in Gross
      - If an easement does not benefit its owner in the use and enjoyment of his land, but merely gives him the right to use the servient land, the easement is in gross. "In Gross" is the term used to signify that benefit of the easement is not appurtenant to other land
