## Easements
### Creation of Easements
#### Affirmative Easements
  - Grants dominant landowner a positive right to use the servient estate for a particular purpose:
    - To do an act that would otherwise be prohibited on the subservient parcel of land
#### Negative Easements
  - Prevents the burdened landowner from exercising rights he otherwise would have on his own land.
  - 4 Categories of Express Negative Easements:
    - Sunlight falling on window
    - Interference with the flow of air in a defined channel
    - Interference with the flow of water in an artificial channel
    - Removing lateral support to buildings.
    - (In some jurisdictions: Protecting Views)
  - No Implied Easement for Light and Air
    - Negative Easement cannot arise by prescription
    - If Structure is useful it will be allowed depsite it being built in spite.
      - Unless solely built in spite. (Spite Fence)
        - Wall or Fence intended to block windows
        - No benefit for the builder except suffering by neighbor (Hard to Prove)

  - Removes existing easement and it ceases to exist upon sale of land
- Termination by Adverse Use
- Abandonment
  - Non-use of easement +;
  - Evidence of intent to abandon
- Cessation of Purpose
  - Easements by necessity terminate if necessity terminates
- Termination by Misuse
  - Expansion of use of an easement is permitted unless expressly stated that it cannot
  - Use with an additional parcel is not permitted.
  - Misuse does not usually forfit an easement
    - So long as shared parcel/building can be severed.
