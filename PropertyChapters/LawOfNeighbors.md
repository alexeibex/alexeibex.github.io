## The Law of Neighbors

### Nuisance and Legal Theory

#### Nuisance
- Private Nuisance
  -  Private nuisance as “a nontrespassory invasion of another’s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.”
  - Protects use & enjoyment
  - Deals with conflicts among uses, e.g. my use of my property makes it inconvenient for you to use your property.
  - Prosser: “Nuisance is an impenetrable jungle.” While the subject may not be impenetrable, it can be complicated.
- Private Nuisance v. Trespass
  - Trespass:
    - An incursion by a physical, tangible object
      - Eg. Dust is not a "physical Tangible Object"
    - That incursion must be Direct
      - A "direct or immediate" invasion for purposes of trespass is one that is accomplished by any means that the offender knew or reasonably should have known would result in the physical invasion of the plaintiff's land.
  - Nuisance:
    - there must be damage proven to receive damages.
    - You also must pass the balancing test.
      - See *[Peckham v. Milroy](link)*

#### Basic Test Framework
- Traditionally: 4 Tests to Distinguish Trespass v. Nuisance
  - Oldest Test
    - Was ∆ act **on** π land or **outside** the π land
      - On Land = Trespass
      - Off Land = Nuisance
  - Direct v. Indirect
    - Direct = Trespass
    - Indirect = Nuisance
  - Tangible or Intangible
    - Tangible = Trespass
      - Items individually visible to the naked eye
    - Intangible = Nuisance
      - Invisible = Traditionally nuisance
  - Did π lose the **enjoyment** or **possession** of their property?
    - **Modern Approach to Nuisance**
      - Loss of Possession = Trespass
      - Loss of Enjoyment = Nuisance

#### Private Nuisance
- To constitute a nuisance, use must produce a tangible & appreciable injury to neighboring property, or render its enjoyment uncomfortable/inconvenient.
  - **Every person may exercise exclusive dominion over his own property**.
    - But, this is limited by the principle of sic utero: use what is yours so as not to injure others. But, does not mean that one may never use his property in a way that injures neighbor though.
  - This principle does not prohibit all injury to others; landowner can do some activities though they will harm others for policy reasons.
  - Every person is bound to make reasonable use of his property so that he does not cause unnecessary damage/annoyance to his neighbor.
    - Reasonable is dependant on **Locality Rule**
      - What occurs in surrounding area. What is lawful in one area, may be unlawful in another.
      - ‘A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, such as a pig in a parlour rather than the barnyard.’
    - Amount of Injury must be significant
      - Tangible or Appreciable Injury
      - Make use of the property especially inconvenient
- Defenses to Nuisance
  - Continuous v. Intermittent
  - Easment by Prescription
  - Coming to the Nuisance
    - Waste Concern - Courts Reluctant to Grant because of Waste concerns
  - Estoppel or Acquiesence
    - See *[Campbell v. Seaman](link)*
