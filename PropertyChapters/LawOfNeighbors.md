## The Law of Neighbors

### Nuisance

#### Ex Ante way of dealing with issues between neighbors
- Private Nuisance
  -  Private nuisance as “a nontrespassory invasion of another’s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.”
  - Protects use & enjoyment
  - Deals with conflicts among uses, e.g. my use of my property makes it inconvenient for you to use your property.
  - Prosser: “Nuisance is an impenetrable jungle.” While the subject may not be impenetrable, it can be complicated.
- Private Nuisance v. Trespass
  - Trespass:
    - An incursion by a physical, tangible object
      - Eg. Dust is not a "physical Tangible Object"
    - That incursion must be Direct
      - A "direct or immediate" invasion for purposes of trespass is one that is accomplished by any means that the offender knew or reasonably should have known would result in the physical invasion of the plaintiff's land.
  - Nuisance:
    - there must be damage proven to receive damages.
    - You also must pass the balancing test.
      - See *[Peckham v. Milroy](link)*

#### Basic Test Framework
- Traditionally: 4 Tests to Distinguish Trespass v. Nuisance
  - See *[Adams v. Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co.](link)*
  - Oldest Test
    - Was ∆ act **on** π land or **outside** the π land
      - On Land = Trespass
      - Off Land = Nuisance
  - Direct v. Indirect
    - Direct = Trespass
    - Indirect = Nuisance
  - Tangible or Intangible
    - Tangible = Trespass
      - Items individually visible to the naked eye
    - Intangible = Nuisance
      - Invisible = Traditionally nuisance
  - Did π lose the **enjoyment** or **possession** of their property?
    - **Modern Approach to Nuisance**
      - Loss of Possession = Trespass
      - Loss of Enjoyment = Nuisance

#### Nuisance Example
- See *[Campbell v. Seaman](link)*

#### Prima Facie Private Nuisance
- See *[Campbell v. Seaman](link)*
  - To constitute a nuisance, use must produce a tangible & appreciable injury to neighboring property, or render its enjoyment uncomfortable/inconvenient.
    - **Every person may exercise exclusive dominion over his own property**.
      - But, this is limited by the principle of sic utero: use what is yours so as not to injure others. But, does not mean that one may never use his property in a way that injures neighbor though.
    - This principle does not prohibit all injury to others; landowner can do some activities though they will harm others for policy reasons.
    - Every person is bound to make reasonable use of his property so that he does not cause unnecessary damage/annoyance to his neighbor.
      - Reasonable is dependant on **Locality Rule**
        - What occurs in surrounding area. What is lawful in one area, may be unlawful in another.
        - ‘A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, such as a pig in a parlour rather than the barnyard.’
      - Amount of Injury must be significant
        - Tangible or Appreciable Injury
        - Make use of the property especially inconvenient

#### Defenses to Nuisance
  - Continuous v. Intermittent
  - Easment by Prescription
    - Like AP, easement by prescription may allow someone to commit a nuisance if they have been doing it long enough.
  - Coming to the Nuisance
    - Waste Concern - Courts Reluctant to Grant because of Waste concerns
    - See *[Campbell v. Seaman](link)* Court Disagrees: Landowners are not allowed to control the future uses of neighbors.
  - Estoppel or Acquiesence
    - Easement by Estoppel
      - Easement to do what would otherwise be a nuisance
      - One of the right in the Bundle is to be "Free From Nuisance"
        - Transferrable Right - Usually in Exchange for Money
      - Court disagrees; this situation doesn't apply here.
        - When P bought land, he didn't know that D would be burning bricks.
        - Before D began burning bricks again, P asked him not to do so. P did nothing that would allow it.
          - See *[Campbell v. Seaman](link)*

#### Remedy to Nuisance
- What relief is available?
  - Injunctive Releif is Available When:
    -Irreperable Injury
      - An injury that cannot be adequately compensated for by money damages
    - Indeterminable litigation & a Multiplicity of Suits
      - See *[Baker v. Hunt](link)* where litigants would have to keep coming to court each time nuisance happened
    - Contrast against permanent future awarded injuries
      - "Jury cannot assess a price for beauty and luxury"
        - Money as compensation to substitute losses albeit not a perfrect substitute
  - Injunction can be denied if its unduly burdensom on the plaintiff.


#### Nuisance Per Se v. Nuisance Per Accidens
- Per Se = Activity is a Nuisance wherever and whenever it is done.
- Per Accidens = Something that in some circumstances may be okay but in other circumstances is a nuisance


#### Natural Intrusions
- Intrusion by a force of nature or natural problem that causes nuisance
  - Example: Roots of a tree extend over the property line
- Traditional Common Law = Trespass
  - Remedy = Self-Help, π has right to dig and cut through the roots but cannot force ∆ to take action. No damages awarded if done.

### Calabresi/Melamed Cathedral
- 2x2 Box

#### Calabresi/Melamed Property Rule 1
- See *[Campbell v. Seaman](link)*
  - Rule 1: Injunction awarded to π.

#### Calabresi/Melamed Liability Rule 2
- Court should refuse injunctive relief when there is a large disparity in economic consequences of the nuisance & injunction.
- Damages create a **servitude** on the land
  - 1 Time Payment allows for nuisance to continue for life.
    - Transfer of Bundle of Rights from Neighbors to Factory
  - Property Rule 1 not appropriate in order to avoid drastic consequences of economic catastrophe of closing the cement plant.
    - Liability Rule as Opposed to a Property Rule when Transaction Costs are high
      - Court must assign the right level of damages in order to acheive optimal result
    - Rule 2: Held For π; liability damages (money) granted to π. ∆ Cement Company has to pay for right to pollute.
  - See *[Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Company, Inc](link)*
    - Question Court Asked: Settling Particular Disupte or resolve case to address public goals (pollution)
      - Rejected: Courts illequipped to handle pollution regulation
        - Example: Courts deciding issues of Global Warming

#### Calabresi/Melamed Liability Rule 3
- See *[Hinman v. Pacific Air Transpo.](link)*


#### Calabresi/Melamed Liability Rule 4
- π must indemnify ∆ for a reasonable amount of cost of moving/shutting down.
  - Ruling in π favor but requiring π to pay to relocate ∆s feed lot.
  - See *[Spur Industries Inc. v. Del E Webb Dev. Co](link)*


### Zoning

#### Defined
- Zoning is the regulation of land uses through a general regime permitting and forbidding particular uses of land in certain locations.
- Municipalities are permitted to restrict private land use through
    - Zoning Ordinances; and,
    - Subdivision Controls
      - (prescribe features of streets, utility lines, etc.; usually deals w/ more obvious externalities than Zoning Ordinances).

#### Criticisms of Zoning
- Government may not be best at deciding what the best use is.
  - Original Twin Towers created more office spaces than required so it was empty.
- Special Exceptions to Zoning Ordinances
  - Provided within the ordinace themselves
- Variance to Zoning Ordinance
  - Too Burdensome to comply, administration can provide variance as an exception


#### Constitutionality of Zoning
- Circumstances & Locality should be considered when determining if zoning restrictions are ok. (reflects nuisance’s idea about “pig in parlor instead of barnyard”)
  - See *[Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.](link)*
    - If the plausibility of the zoning ordinance is fairly debatable, that is good enough. (this is basically Rational Basis level of scrutiny. The court concludes that this is constitutional, even tho this property is being more restricted than most other props). Town had a rational purpose of excluding harmful industry.
    - The Court held that a zoning ordinance would be upheld against substantive due process and equal protection attack unless it was arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, welfare, or morals.
- Exclusionary Zoning
  - Zoning of persons is unconstitutional
    - Violation of due process and freedom to contract
  - Zoning might still be implicitly motivated and have discriminatory effects
- Critiques of Zoning
  - Rent Seeking
