## Servitudes
- Servitudes create an interest in land that bind and benefit the parties to an agreement and their successor.


### Easements & Covenants

#### Introduction
- Easements are a grant of an interest in another's land that entitles someone to **use** the land possessed by another.
- Easements typically "run with the land" (Apply to successive owners of property)
- Must be in writing (Statute of Frauds)
- Creation by Grant or Reservation
  - Example: Selling of "Bundle" MINUS one stick (access/easement)
- Cannot be used for adverse possession, no hostility
- Types of Easements
  - Express
  - Licenses
  - Implied by prior existing use, by necessity, by prescription
  - Negative
- Affirmative: Owner of an affirmative easement (positive easement) has a right to go onto the land of another and do some act on the land
- Negative: Owner of a negative easement can prevent the owner of the servient land from doing some act on the servient land.
- Easement Appurtenant: Grants a right to the owner of the land that benefits from the easement to make use of another’s land, i.e., it benefits the land belonging to the easement owner. Usually transferable.
- Easement in Gross: Grants a right to some person, regardless of owner- ship of land, to make use of another’s land, i.e., it benefits the easement owner directly.


#### Easements Appurtenant or In Gross
  - All easements are either **appurtenant** to other land or **in gross**
    - Easements Appurtenant
      - Belong to another parcel of land - (right to travel across another's land to access road)
        - Access across parcel A (Servient) is appurtenant to Parcel B (Dominant)
      - If an easement benefits its owner in the use of another tract of land, it is appurtenant to that land. The land benefited is called the dominant tenement, the land burdended is the servient tenement. The servient tenement usually is, but does not have to be adjacent to the dominant tenant.
      - Ownership of easement transfers along with Dominant Parcel Ownership = Owners are **Tenants**
      - Easements = Servient/Dominant Estates
    - Easement in Gross
      - Stays with the grantee not with the owner of the Dominant Parcel, only sometimes transferrable depends on nature of easement.
        - Most courts will not recognize **recreational** easements in gross.
      - If an easement does not benefit its owner in the use and enjoyment of his land, but merely gives him the right to use the servient land, the easement is in gross.
      - "In Gross" is the term used to signify that benefit of the easement is not appurtenant to other land.
      - Not revocable like licenses
        - See *[Baseball Publishing Co. v. Bruton](link)*
    - Distinguishing Easements
      - Determined by the **Intent of the Parties**
        - Courts will examine circumstances of creation = Does this add to the use and enjoyment of the neighboring land (appurtenant) or not (in gross)
        - Generally lean toward appurtenant easements if difficult


#### Creation of Easements
- Easement in Gross created by Grant
  - Does not benefit the owner in the use and enjoyment of his land, but merely gives him a right to use the servient land, easement is in Gross
    - See *[Baseball Publishing Co. v. Bruton](link)*
- Distinguish from [Licenses](link)
  - Licenses give permission to go on property, difference is that licenses are **revocable**
  - Licenses:
    1. License: permission to allow the licensee to do something that would otherwise be a trespass—e.g., plumbers, dinner guests.
    2. Licenses are revocable. Easements are not.
    3. However, there are two circumstances in which a license is not revocable:
      1. A license coupled with an interest, e.g., the right to harvest timber from the grantor’s land.
      2. A license can become irrevocable under the rules of estoppel (i.e., when the licensee spends significant money or labor, and the licensor knows or reasonably expects that the licensee will rely on the license). See *[Holbrook v. Taylor.](link)*

##### Easement Created by Necessity/Implied Easement
  - The easement is necessary for the enjoyment of the land, and the neces- sity arose upon severance of the dominant and servient parcels.
    - Requirements:
      - Must have been 1 common owner of all the plots
      - Owner must have chopped the property into different parcels
      - The parcel in question is landlocked (no access to public road).
        - Geographic barries will not create an easement by necessity as long access can be done reasonably expensed.
        - If Easement were to exist, it goes across the property that created the easement for necessity.
          - See *[Schwab v. Timmons](link)*
  - Policy Argument for Easements
    - Buyer of land should be able to rely on public records.
      - Buyer knows what they are buying with no worry of potential easements arising.

#### Easement by Prescription
  - Similar to [adverse possession](link), with no exclusivity requirement, but leading to **use** (1 stick in bundle of rights), not **possession** (whole bundle).
    - Use must be open and notorious
      - Must be made without any attempt of concealment.
    - Adverse and under a claim of right
      - Demonstrated by continuous use without protest by owner and no permission given to party seeking easement
    - Continuous and uninteruppted for the statutory period - (shorter than adverse possession)
      - Must be continuous not constant, continuity
    - Exclusive (meaning distinct from the general public’s use, but not necessarily exclusive of the true owner)
      - Extra Requirement for *Warsaw*: Must be a definite & certain line of travel for the statutory period.
  - See *[Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings Inc.](link)*


#### Easement by Estopple
- Sometimes known as **irrevocable licenses**
- The licensor knows or reasonably expects that the licensee will rely on the license
- Recipient of the easement spent money in reliance of the permission
- If the licensee has made substantial improvements in reliance on the license, the licensor is estopped from revoking the license.
  - See *[Holbrook v. Taylor](link)*
