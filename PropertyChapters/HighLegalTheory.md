## High Property Theory
### The Coase Theorum
- Irrespective of how the law allocates entitlements, parties will bargain for socially optimal result
#### Nuisance is a Problem of Reciprocal Causation
- A problem of social inefficiency & diminishing total wealth of society
- "Nuisances are problems of Reciprocal Causation." = It doesn't make sense to determine who is causing the nuisance.
  - See *[Campbell v. Seaman](link)*
    - Brickwork v. Vegitation
    - Each party causes nuisance as both are a **But For** cause of the loss of *wealth*
- No matter which party is penalized, somebody is injured and suffers harm
  - **Problem is to avoid the more serious harm**
- Because both parties cause the problem
- Both parties should internalize their decisions that led to the conflict
- Goal is to have minimal harm
  - People will always interact in a way that results in the lowest *transaction costs*

#### **Key Assumptions of Coase**
  - Assumption 1: **All Value Can Be Compensated by Money**
    - Place $ Value on Everything
  - Assumption 2: **All Actors are Rational Maximizers**
  - Assumption 3: **Bargaining is Costless**
  - Assumption 4: **Distribution of Wealth Does Not Matter**


#### Examples
- Factory v. Laundry
  - Issue: Factory Smoke on Clean Clothes
  - Cost of Operating Factory = High
  - Cost of Operating Laundry = Low
  - Detriment suffered by Laundry = -30
- Both parties have options to prevent conflict
  - Factory could install scrubbers = -20
  - Laundry could install Screens = -10
- Laundry Sues:
- Rational Maximizers
- Case 1:
  - Factory Wins: Laundry prefers to install screen rather than suffer loss
  - (F) + ((L) - 10)
- Case 2:
  - Laundry Wins: Factory alternative to shutting down and losing high value is to install scrubbers (-20)
  - **But Assumption 3** Baragining is Costless
    - Factory could instead pay Laundry to install screens (-20) v. Install Scrubbers (-20)
      - Factory as a rational maximizer would **SAVE** 10
  - Implication 1: Ultimate Result would be the same regardless of Court Ruling
    - Both Examples: Laundry Install's Screens and Law was irrelevent
      - Coin Flip

#### Calculating Coase Theorum
- Total Wealth = All Results are the Same: **(F + L) - 10** (Maximization of Total Wealth)
  - (F) + (L) - 10
  - (F) - 10 + L
  - (F) - 13 + L + 3
- Comparing to Alternatives
  - Factory Shutdown
    - Total Wealth = L
  - Factory Install Scrubbers
    - Total Wealth = F - 20 + L
  - Laundry Shutsdown
    - Total Wealth = F
  - Laundry Suffers Pollution
    - Total Wealth = F + L - 30
- All Alternatives are less than **(F + L) - 10**
  - But **Total** Amount of Wealth is greater but **Distribution** is not considered
    - In various cases, Courts decision **Does** affect the distribution of wealth between parties
    - Courts may favor one party over another based on policy or encouragement of certain aspects of parties (Factories v. Laundrys)
- Total Wealth Relies on All Assumptions Being True
  - If impediments to bargaining then Total Wealth will drop.
    - Coase: Costless Bargaining is **Extremely** Unrealistic
  - Parties may not be rational
  - Holdout Problems if in Aggregate
  - Incompetance of Parties
  - Uncertainty inherent to costs


#### Creative Alternatives Outside of Court
  - Creative Contract Bargaining
    - Don't operate F when winds are blowing


### Calabresi/Melamed - Nuisance/Trespass
#### Property v. Liability
#### Key Insight
  - Courts Face 2 Decisions when there are conflicting interests
    - Decision 1: Who Wins/Who Loses - Who Gets the Entitlement
    - Decision 2: How should that entitlement be protected
      - Protection by Property Rules
      - Protection by Liabilty Rules
      - Entitlements that are inalienable

#### 2 x 2 Matrix
- (Also Inalienable Entitlements) not included
  - Entitlement does not change hands
    - Cannot sell oneself into slavery


  | Property Rule  |  Liability Rule
--|---|--
Plaintiff  | Rule 1: Eg: Injunction  |  Rule 2
Defendant  | Rule 3  |  Rule 4

- Outcomes
  - Rule 1: Court Assignes Plaintiff Injunction Entitlement
    - Coasient Bargaining: ∆ can purchase entitlement from π bundle in a voluntary transaction at a price agreed by π.
      - Trespass
        - See *[Pile v. Pedrick](link)*
      - Nuisance
        - See *[Campbell v. Seamen](link)*
  - Rule 2: Money Damages set by Court/3rd Party (Market)
    - Trespass
      - See *[Golden Press v. Rilance](link)*
    - Nuisance
      - See *[Boomer v. Atlantic Smith](link)*
  - Rule 3: Court Assignes Defendant Injunction Entitlement
    - Coasient Bargaining: ∆ can purchase entitlement from π bundle in a voluntary transaction at a price agreed by π.
    - Trespass
      - See *[Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport](link)*
  - Rule 4:
