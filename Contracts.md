## 1.0 Introduction to Contracts

- Deal with the Devil
  - Basic contract law principles. One party wants something right away the other must wait.
  - Take the future effectively make it the present by contract
- [Nick Szabo on Contracts](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)
  - The contract, a set of promises agreed to in a "meeting of the minds", is the traditional way to formalize a relationship.
  - Whether enforced by a government, or otherwise, the contract is the basic building block of a free market economy. Over many centuries of cultural evolution has emerged both the concept of contract and principles related to it, encoded into common law.

### 1.1 Contracts
- **Contract** = **Offer** + **Acceptance** + **Consideration**
- Legality of Contracts:
  - Agreements that our legal system will enforce and permit.
- Considerations required for legal enforcement for Contracts
  3. Surrogacy example
    - Baby for money?
  4. Committed relationships between two consenting individuals
    - Law School for future expected earnings?
- Promissory Liability is the Foundation of Contract Law
- Contracts enhance trust and create the ability to function in a free market economy
- The Freedom of contract is a foundational for functioning society
- A lawyer's job is to anticipate potential problems and work for client to help protect against harmful outcomes.
- Cases arise from differing interpretation of contracts
- Most Contracts end up in settlement through negotiations or settlement.
- Damages/Punitive Damages:
  - As a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract. Although damages in excess of compensation for loss are in some instances permitted in tort actions by way of punishment, in contract actions the damages recoverable are limited to compensation for pecuniary loss sustained by the breach.

#### Basic Contract Dispute
#### Case: *[White v. Benkowski](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/b6f5c0d1-fc87-40c2-8892-09fd07d1d5d2/?context=1000516)*

<summary>Case Brief</summary>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Tenants were entitled to the actual damages amount determined by the jury, but they were not entitled to punitive damages because punitive damages were not recoverable in breach of contract actions.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Contract drawn up between 2 families on adjacent properties. πs desired to purchase home w/o water supply. Adjacent property owned by ∆s had a well w/ pipes connected to home of π.</li>
        <li>Parites entered into a written agreement.</li>
        <li>10 Years unless municple water became supplied or well became inadequate. Water for money at rate of $3 a month + 1/2 cost of future repairs or maintenance.</li>
        <li>Not in written agreement, π lso $400 dollars given to ∆s to purchase and install new pump and tanks to increase capacity.</li>
        <li>Relationship deteriorated overtime and became hostile.</li>
        <li>∆(B) began shutting off water. 4 time periods recorded.</li>
        <li> First case awarded $2,000 in punitive damages and $10 in compensatory damages. On motion after the verdict, court reduced compensatory award to $1 and granted ∆s motion to strike punitive damage question & answer.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Was the trial court correct in reducing the award of compensatory damages from $10 to $1?</li>
        <li>Are punitive damages available in actions for breach of contract when there is an allegation based on a breach of wanton/malicious act?</li>
      </ol>

    <li><b>Rule:</b>In Wisconsin, compensatory damages are given to make whole the damage or injury suffered by the injured party. On the other hand, punitive damages are given on the basis of punishment to the injured party not because he has been injured, which injury has been compensated with compensatory damages, but to punish the wrongdoer for his malice and to deter others from like conduct.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that the tenants were entitled to $ 10 because that figure was the actual damages determined by the jury and the trial court should not have disturbed that finding The court, however, held that the tenants were not entitled to punitive damages because punitive damages were not recoverable in breach of contract actions. The court held that in some cases where a breach of contractual duty led to a tort violation, punitive damages could be available. However, the court held that because no tort was pled or proven by the tenants, they were not entitled to punitive damages.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Compensatory Damages - Make Whole</li>


  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**:
  - Context for the case: "This case involves a neighborhood squabble between two adjacent property owners."
  - Compensatory Damages
    - Nominal v. Compensatory
  - Punitive Damages
    - “If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;
he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.”
    - Corbin states that as a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract.
      - Allusion to authority.
      - Court fell short of providing **reasons** why punitive damages are not proper.
      - Although it is well recognized that breach of a contractual duty **may be a** tort, in such situations the contract creates the relation out of which grows the duty to use care in the performance of a responsibility prescribed by the contract. Not so here. No tort was pleaded or proved. **Critique of White's Attorney**

## 2.0 Remedies
- How does the law treat someone who has been harmed by a breach of contract?
  - Common Law Remedies can be flexible and attept to help promisee.
  - UCC tries to make promisee whole + incurred costs "for goods"

### 2.1 Common Law Remedies
- **Compensatory** damages, which are given to the party which was detrimented by the breach of contract.
  1. **Expectation**: Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract had been *performed*. "You get what you bargained for"
  2. **Reliance**: Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract had *not been made*.
  3. **Restitution**: Restors to the promisee any benefit he conferred to the promisor.
  4. Expectation damages are the difference between promised performance and actual performance—for instance, between a perfect hand and a hairy, scarred hand. *Hawkins v. McGee*.

- **Nominal** damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.

- **Punitive** or **exemplary** damages are used to punish the party at fault; Contract law does not recognize punitive damages.


### 2.2 Reliance
#### Case: *[Sullivan v. O'Connor](Link)*
- The appropriate measure of damages is the difference between (1) performance of the contract as promised and (2) actual performance.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Where a plastic surgeon promised to improve a patient's appearance and did not, patient could obtain damages for breach of contract, including damages for expenses and for pain and suffering beyond that contemplated.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A surgeon performed plastic surgery upon a patient’s nose two times. Dissatisfied with the results because the surgery disfigured and deformed her nose, she sued for breach of a contract to improve her appearance. The jury found in her favor and awarded damages for expenses and for pain and suffering. The case was elevated to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was there a breach of contract to improve appearance?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Some cases have taken the simple view that the promise by the physician is to be treated like an ordinary commercial promise, and accordingly that the successful plaintiff is entitled to a standard measure of recovery for breach of contract, compensatory damages, an amount intended to put the plaintiff in the position he would be in if the contract had been performed. The plaintiff may elect restitution damages, an amount corresponding to any benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant in the performance of the contract disrupted by the defendant's breach.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the patient could bring a breach of contract action against her doctor because he made promises of a specific outcome, and that pain and suffering beyond that contemplated were compensable. Entitled to recover out of pocket expenses, but also for worsening of the appearance of her nose by the surgery and for pain and suffering and mental distress involved in a third operation. </li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

#### Class Discussion
- Breach of Contract Claim + Negligent Malpractice Tort
  - Jury awarded verdict of $13.5K for Breach of Contract
    - Contract to "Enhance Beauty + Improve Appearence"
  - No Negligent Malpractice
- ∆ claimed restitution should only get cost of surgery (Compensatory)
- ∆ claimed jury instruction for damages in excess
- π would claim Lost Expectancy
  - Formulaic? Not a "Good"
    - Botched Nose v. Enhanced Expected Nose (Subjective)
- Court dodged the bullet by not addressing Lost Expectancy Damages
- Court rules in favor of Reliance Damages (Pre-K)
  - Reliance damages designed to put the π in the monetary position he or she would have been in if the agreement or promise had not been made;
    - Compensation for 3rd operation
    - Compensation for medical expenses associated with 3rd operation
- Hawkins v. McGee (Hairy Hand) = Expected Hand v. Hairy Hand
  - π Entitled to difference in value between two hands
- Medical Science is not an exact science. Court is skeptical of Doctors promises as interpreted by patients
- Policy considerations
  - Too Strict?
    - Raised prices for surgery
    - Defensive medicine
    - Volume of contract disputes
    - Sympathetic juries allocating damages
  - Too Lenient?

### 2.3 Remedies Under The Uniform Commerical Code
##### Article 1 - Remedies to be liberally Administered
  - Compensatory Damages + Search Costs

##### Article 2 of the UCC
- Applies to "Transactions in goods"
  - "Goods" includes "all things" which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale
- Adopted by all states except by Louisiana

## 3.0 Obligation Arising from an Agreement with Consideration

- Consideration is one of the basic requirements of the leading theory of obligation in contractual and related affairs.
  - Consideration = C
  - Consideration is giving something and getting something in return. Both parties get something they want from one another.
- Courts are hesitent to interfere with private transactions (exceptions)
- Consideration has two elements:
  1. Mutual Assent
  2. Exchange of Value
- A Valid Agreement w/ Consideration = (A w/ C)

### 3.1 Freedom of Transaction

#### Case: *[Hardesty v. Smith](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/f0f3a33f-a251-40dd-8ba8-447935669cde/?context=1000516)*

*Freedom of Contract. Freedom to make a good or bad deal*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> π sold rights to an invention, allegedly improving a lamp to ∆. Supposed improvement was worthless</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>Parties of sufficient mental capacity for the management of their own business, have a right to make their own bargains.</li>
    <li>"The doing of an act by one at the request of another, which may be a detriment or inconvenience, however slight, to the party doing it, or may be a benefit, however slight, to the party at whose request it is performed, is a legal consideration for a promise by such requesting party"</li>
      <ul>
        <li>...upon his own judgment, uninfluenced by fraud, or warranty, or mistake of facts...</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Judgement is reversed with costs.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    When a party gets all the consideration he honestly contracted for, he cannot say he gets no consideration, or that it has failed. If the doctrine be not correct, then it is not true that parties are at liberty to make their own contracts.
  </ul>

</details>

- *Class Discussion*
  - Exchange: Invention x Promissory Notes
    - Consideration Issue
      - π claims invention is worthless
      - So trial court rules that consideration is invalid
      - Appellate court reverses on basis of freedom of contract
  - Court will not infringe on freedom of contract
  - Courts examine the EXISTENCE of consideration not the
    - Subjective value is up to the parties
      - Slippery slope argument
  - Consideration does not have to = to expected promise
  - Rule: The doing of an act by one at the request of another, which may be a detriment or inconvenience, however slight, to the party doing it, or may be a benefit, however slight, to the party at whose request it is performed, is a legal consideration for a promise by such requesting party


### 3.2  Donative Promises, Form & Reliance
- Made for affective reasons, usually informal, and not demonstrably relied upon.
  - Executed Promise (Gift) is not the same.

*Donative promises are not enforceable.*

#### Case: *[Dougherty v. Salt](Link)*

- Theories of Obligation
  - Consideration = Bargain for exchange
    - Consideration with writing with a Witness
      - Aunt received no benefit
        - Good feelings/Alturism is not consideration
    - Promissary Exchange
      - Not a present exchange
      - Note indicates "past consideration"
    - Value Received - "Done for me"
      - Cardozo - No Value Received from the boy
- Court will not enforce a "gift promises as contracts"
- **Voidable Legal Capcity for contract**
  - 9 year old contract is **voidable**
    - Infant can claim from party
    - Party cannot claim from infant

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A promissory note that was payable on death, which given to a boy by his aunt who wanted to take care of him, was the voluntary and unenforceable promise of an executory gift, and he was not entitled to payment in his action against the executrix.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The boy's aunt told his guardian, who was a witness for him at trial, that she loved the boy and wanted to take care of him, so she gave him a note payable at her death, which had the words "value received" on it. She died, and in the boy's action against his aunt's executrix for payment of the note, the trial court submitted the question of whether there was consideration for the promised payment to the jury, who returned a verdict in the boy's favor. The trial court set aside the verdict and dismissed the complaint. The appellate court reversed the judgment, and reinstated the verdict, holding that the note was sufficient evidence of consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether a promissory note with the label “value received” issued by the aunt out of her love to her nephew sufficiently establishes consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment, modified the trial court's judgment by granting a new trial, and affirmed the judgment as modified. Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

##### Restatement (First) of Contracts § 75.
- Definition of Consideration.
  1. Consideration for a promise is
    - an act other than a promise, or
    - a forbearance, or
    - the creation, modification or destruction of a legal relation, or
    - a return promise,
 2. AND; bargained for and given in exchange for the promise.
    - Consideration may be given to the promisor or to some other person. It may be given by the promisee or by some other person.


#### 3.2.1 Bare Naked Promise & Consideration
- Acceptance alone is not consideration, but at some point acceptance becomes an act that qualifies as consideration

#### Problem 2-1
1. Consideration could have been given to promisor if promisee was *Induced* by exchange.

#### The Substantive Bases of Contract Liability

- Lon Fuller introduced **substantive** and **process** bases for enforcing promises.
- The two process bases are **evidentiary** *(making sure a promise has actually been made)* and **cautionary** *(preventing inconsiderate action by the promisor)*.
  - **Evidentiary**: Evidentiary security—protecting against manufactured evidence and dealing with insufficient proof.
    - Bargained-for exchange **tends** to produce evidence that a promise was made.
    - Written v. Oral promises as evidence
  - **Cautionary**: Safeguarding the individual against his own rashness.
    - Cautionary process requires promisor to consider legal consequences for promise.
    - Writing out promises requires thought and pause.
  - Simple donative promises are problematic on both bases.
    - People make gift promises all the time
   - They raise problems of proof (evidence may be uncertain) and deliberativeness (the promisor is likely to be emotionally involved with the promisee).
   - Substantive reasons for enforcing donative promises include compensating the promisee’s disappointment (a form of injury), move assets from the wealthy to the less wealthy, and increase the likelihood of beneficial reliance. But these substantive bases are open to question.
  - **Channeling**: Signaling to make sure that the promisor knows the
 promise is enforceable.
    - offers parties a recognizeable method of entering an enforceable obligation.
      - Distinct set of instruction for parties who want to enter into an enforceable exchange.
   - Lease as a contract provides signal to promisee
  - **Deterrent**: Unwillingness to enforce contracts of “suspect or marginal
 value.”



#### Case: *[Maughs v. Porter](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/83b69d1f-aa65-4f2d-a22b-8b881846bcdd/?context=1000516)*

- Plaintiff auction winner appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County (Virginia), which sustained defendant auctioneer's demurrer in the auction winner's action for a money judgment.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An auction winner was unable to recover a money judgment against an auctioneer where the bargain was unenforceable as against public policy because the transaction was consistent with the scheme of a lottery, which was prohibited by state law.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The auction winner won an automobile at an auction organized and advertised by the auctioneer. The auctioneer refused to pay for the automobile when it was delivered and refused to pay the auction winner the value of the car. The circuit court sustained the demurrer filed by the auctioneer in the auction winner's action for a money judgment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the alleged offer to make the gift can be enforced as supported by a sufficient consideration and if it should be determined that there was such a consideration as would otherwise support the gift then:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether the transaction constitutes a lottery which is prohibited by Constitution & Statute</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The intention to give must be accompanied by a delivery, and the delivery must be made with an intention to give. Otherwise there is only an intention or promise to give, which, being gratuitous, would be a mere nullity. Delivery of possession of the thing given or of the means of obtaining it so as to make the disposal of it irrevocable, is indispensable to a valid gift.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>There **was sufficient consideration** to support the gift and but for the other questions involved this would determine the case but the court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court that the bargain was unenforceable and denied the auction winner recovery in the auction winner's action for a money judgment against the auctioneer.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>A gift is a contract without a consideration, and to be valid must be executed. A valid gift is therefore a contract executed.</li>
        <li>Contracts founded upon an illegal consideration, as being contrary to public policy and forbidden by law, are void.</li>
      </ol>
  </ul>

- Advertisement calls for attendance.
  - ∆ benefits by hope of deriving benefit from the crowd so augmented.
  - π claims attendance was induced by advertisement and qualifies as consideration.
  - As in Hardesty, Time in attendence = detriment/inconvenience
- ∆ argument claims it is just a gift with a condition, no consideration and not enforceable.
  - Gift was a condition of a promise. *See Tramp Example*
- ∆ was conducting business in hopes of profit.
  - "Free" not actually "Free"
  - Opposite Daughtery where promise was purely motivated by emotion.

#### Tramp/Homeless Hypo
- **Class Discussion**
  - I’ll call the store and have two suits ready for you. You go to the store and find out I was just kidding. **There’s no consideration.** But what if I make you drive to a store in San Francisco? Is that an act that constitutes consideration? I got what I wanted (for you to go to the store) and you thought you were getting what you wanted (new clothes).
  - Promise of a coat induces a walk around the corner to go to the shop
    - Tramp gives up his legal right to hang on the street to go walk around the block.
      - Court don't question adequecy of consideration
      - Detriment was not requested as the price of the promise, but was merely a condition of a **gratuitous promise.**
        - Walking around the corner is not motivating the promisor to give the coat.
  - Acceptance alone is not consideration, but at some point acceptance becomes an act that qualifies as consideration.


#### Case: *[Carlisle v. T  & R Excavating Inc](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/a92b0db1-cb4c-44da-9bd0-1cab856e2f8f/?context=1000516)*
  - Appellant husband sought review of a decision by the Common Pleas Court, Medina County (Ohio) that entered judgment in favor of appellee wife, in the wife's breach of contract action against the husband.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An agreement providing for reimbursement of materials used to perform free services was not a bargained-for exchange sufficient to form a contract where the promise to provide free services was not made to induce the promise of reimbursement.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In contemplation of divorce, the husband entered into a separation agreement with the wife, although they continued living together for some time afterwards. The agreement provided that in repayment for the wife's services to the husband's business, the husband would provide construction services for the wife's business, and the wife would reimburse the husband for the cost of material. Shortly after the couple separated, the husband discontinued services. The husband contended that there was no contract because the agreement lacked sufficient consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the judgment in favor of the wife. Without consideration there can be no contract. Consideration consists of either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The court found that: 1) the husband's motivation to help the wife's business for furtherance of the relationship or increased marital income was not sufficient consideration; 2) there was no evidence that the husband bargained away the free services to his wife in exchange for the benefit of collecting the cost of materials paid; 3) repayment for services suggested past consideration that was insufficient to form a contract; 4) the promise to reimburse for materials was a condition for a gratuitous promise; and 5) the separation agreement and its contents was invalid because the couple did not immediately separate.</li>

#### 3.3 Sufficient Consideration
Any bargained-for act or forbearance constitutes consideration. There is no mutuality requirement.

#### Case: *[Hamer v. Sidway](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-hamer-v-sidway.aspx)*

- Plaintiff appealed from an order of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a judgment in his favor in an action to enforce a contract.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Forbearance or abandonment of legal right to use tobacco and alcohol in exchange for the payment of a sum of money was sufficient consideration to enforce the contract.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A testator made an agreement with his nephew that if he refrained from drinking liquor, using tobacco, swearing and playing cards or billiards for money until he reached the age of twenty-one, the testator would pay him $ 5,000. The nephew fulfilled his obligation. When the nephew informed his uncle, it was agreed that the uncle would first keep the money on interest. Unfortunately, the uncle died before any money could be transferred to the nephew. Filing a case for sum of money with the trial court, the judgment was rendered in favor of the nephew but later on reversed by the General Term of the Supreme Court. The case was elevated on appeal to the Court of Appeals of New York.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is a promise to abandon ones legal rights to use tobacco and alcohol considered sufficient consideration to enforce a contract?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Consideration means not so much that one party is profiting as that the other abandons some legal right in the present, or limits his legal freedom of action in the future, as an inducement for the promise of the first.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> It is enough that something is promised done forborne or suffered by the party to whom the promise is made as consideration for the promise made to him.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>It is sufficient that he restricted his lawful freedom of action within certain prescribed limits upon the faith of his uncle's agreement</li>
        <li>The Court held that the right to use and enjoy the use of tobacco is a right that belongs to the nephew and is not forbidden by law. The abandonment of its use is a sufficient consideration to uphold the promise because such abandonment was the inducement for the promise.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Is this a gift with a consideration or bargain for exchange.
  - Detriment to the promisee v. Inducement by the Promisor
  - Detriment is subjective to the person.
    - As long as giving up a legal right or freedom.
  - Promise induced detriment - Motivation of Promisor
    - Uncle's motive was to extract the forbearance from newphew
      - Some discussion that newphew's detriment of legal right was enough.
    - But did the detriment induce the promise?
    - Uncle grandstanding/concerned with reputation of family name




##### Restatement (Second) Of Contracts § 81
  - Consideration as Motive or Inducing Cause
    1. The fact that what is bargained for does not of **itself solely** induce the making of a promise does not prevent it from being consideration for the promise.
    2. The fact that a promise does not of itself induce a performance or return promise does not prevent the performance or return promise from being consideration for the promise.

#### 3.4 Bargained Theory & Mutual Inducement
- Courts generally do not consider the adequacy of consideration.
  - In a bargained for exchange, promise is said to be supported by consideration because the promisor gets "something in exchange for his/her promise"
    - As long as you are getting **"a something"**
  - Must demonstrate that parties "agreed to exchange"
- The **mutuality rule** required both parties to be obligated to each other, but it did not require **equal consideration.**
  - Broad: “consideration” refers collectively to the things that make contracts legally enforceable—e.g., bargain or reliance.
  - Narrow: “consideration” is the same thing as “bargain.” The Restate- ment Second adopts this approach, known as the bargain theory of consideration.
- The bargain theory of consideration creates two kinds of distortion:
  - **Terminological**: many other elements besides bargain can make a contract enforceable. Therefore, “under the terminology of the Re- statement Second, a promise needs consideration to be enforceable unless it does not need consideration to be enforceable.”
  - **Substantive**: the bargain theory presumes that all nonbargain promises are unenforceable. It does not allow the law to develop other means of making promises enforceable.


#### Forbearance
A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.

    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The lessor leased gas stations to a lessee doing business as the oil company he was buying. The lessee could not meet payments due to the oil company and assigned accounts receivable, including those involving the lessor's gas stations. The oil company installed its agent in the lessee's office and collected rents paid by the filing station operators. </li>

    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed the district court's order granting the oil company's motion for a JNOV. The oil company's installation of the agent in the lessee's office to collect money due the lessee and assigned to the oil company did not make it liable to pay the lessee's rent. The agent's promise to the lessor to pay rent was unenforceable because there was no consideration, and the promise did not amount to a contract.</li>

- Plaintiffs brought a diversity action against defendants for breach of an oral contract, breach of implied warranty, violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, and promissory estoppel, arising from a promise to replace defective windows. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on all four claims. Plaintiffs appealed.


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim failed because defendants' alleged promise to replace the remaining defective windows in plaintiffs' house lacked consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π bought some windows from ∆. Windows were defective. ∆ assured π to fix windows. When ∆ did not fix windows in alotted time π brought suite. **Promise to Repair**</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> a hypothetical and tangential benefit to defendants' reputation was not sufficient consideration to make defendants' promise to replace the windows a binding contract.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
  - ∆ allege promise to repair lacks consideration
  - π allege 3 types of consideration
    - forbearance of their legal claims
      - First claim: Court determines that there was **no express/implied** threat to sue.
          - Therefore no forbearance
    - Time and labor expended assisting marvin in connection with marvin'ss promise to repalce the defective windows.
      - Like *Maughs v. Porter* where women went to event to win car
      - Court rejected the claim that time and labor were not sufficient consideration
      - Price = Promise?
        - Effort/Time expended on repairing windows != price of fixing windows
    - The benefit Marvin received to their reputation by agreeing to replace windows.
      - ∆ would get benefit by building his reputation that he fixes windows, good company reviews.
        - Not every benefit is consideration
        - **Court rejected claim that a hypothetical/tangential benefit to reputation is sufficient consideration**

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendant was entitled to share in the proceeds from the sale of a parcel of land inherited by defendant and plaintiff because plaintiffs' alleged promise to forego any interest in the land lacked consideration and was not enforceable.</li>

    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court concluded that plaintiffs had no colorable right to the property received by defendants so there was no consideration or contract.
</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Consideration = **Forbearance** - We Promise = "We will give you our share in the Sackett street property if you don't bother us about the Atlantic avenue property"
  - Bargain-for exchange?
    - Seems like parties are trying to make an exchange.
      - Court **rejects this as consideration**
    - π had to have something to exchange in the first place.
  - It seems to be the rule with us that it is not essential that the claim should be valid; but it is enough if it could be regarded as **doubtful or colorable**

#### Corbin on Contracts
  - Forbearance to bring a suit or to proceed with one already brought, or to press a claim in any other way, is not consideration if the forbearance is made with knowledge that the claim is invalid.
    - On grounds of public policy
      - If recognized as consideration, **invalid claims would be infinitely increased in number and blackmail would become a profitable racket.**
      - Blackmailing for forbearance to use.
      - Example "Money or else claim for Sexual assault"

#### 3.5 Mutuality of Obligation
#### Case: *[De Los Santos v. Great Western Sugar Company](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/26dd8315-cbcd-46a8-9826-29cad4ff229d/?context=1000516)*
- Plaintiff trucker appealed from a decision of the District Court for Scotts Bluff County (Nebraska), which granted summary judgment for defendant sugar company in the trucker's action for breach of contract.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A sugar company was not liable for breach of contract when it terminated a trucker's services for hauling beets after two months because the contract did not specify a quantity of beets and allowed the company to terminate at any time.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The trucker, an independent contractor, entered a contract with the sugar company that called for the trucker to haul only such tonnage of beets as might be loaded by the sugar company upon the trucker's trucks. The sugar company terminated the trucker after two months of hauling. The trucker contended that he was entitled to haul until all of the beets had been transported to the factory.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Mutuality is absent when one only of the contracting parties is bound to perform</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The contract was unenforceable because neither the trucker nor the sugar company intended to or did, either in fact or law, promise to transport a specific quantity of beets or promise to transport beets during a specific period of time. The term of the contract did not constitute a promise, but merely established the period of time during which the promises that were contained in the contract would be in effect. The sugar company's right to control the amount of beets loaded onto the trucker's trucks was a right to terminate the contract at any time, and rendered the contract as to its unexecuted portions void for want of mutuality.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
  - π Claim: Entitled to continue to haul until all the beets had been transported to the factory.
  - ∆ Claim: Not obligated under the contract to allow the π to haul any particular amount of tonnage and that its determination that it would not longer require π services was a determination which was within the ∆s discretion under the terms.
  - Consideration = No promise by ∆ to load beets into truck.
    - "may be loaded"
    - Promise to pay but not specifying quantity is an "**illusory**" promise.
    - No guarantee by promisor to do anything at all = **No Commitment/No obligation = No Promise**
      - Such a promise **lacks mutuality**
  - Both sides not obligated by the contract and not bound
    - **If one side is not bound then another side is not bound**

#### Implied Obligation & Good Faith
- The intent of the parties outweighs “primitive formalism.”

#### Case: *[Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-wood-v-lucy-lady-duff-gordon.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A marketer was entitled to performance of an implied contract with a fashion designer where mutuality of obligation existed, although imperfectly expressed, with express promises of sales and profit sharing.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant is a "creator of fashions" whose favor helps a sale, and manufacturers of feminine apparel are willing to pay for a certificate of her approval. She entered into an agreement with plaintiff employing him to turn this vogue into money. He was to have, for the term of one year, and thereafter unless terminated by a written notice, the exclusive right, subject to her approval, to place her indorsements on the designs of others and in return she was to have one-half of all profits and revenues derived from any contract he might make. Plaintiff claims that he kept the contract and that the defendant broke it, by placing her indorsement on articles without his knowledge and withholding the profits, and sues her for the damages. Defendant demurs to the complaint on the ground that the agreement lacks the elements of a contract in that plaintiff does not bind himself to anything. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is there mutuality in the contract?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A promise may be lacking within a contract, and yet the whole writing may be instinct with an obligation, imperfectly expressed. If that is so, there is a contract. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that upon examination of the contract, although plaintiff does not promise in express terms, such a promise is fairly implied. Defendant gave an exclusive privilege and plaintiff's promise to pay one-half of the profits and revenues resulting from the exclusive agency and to render accounts monthly, was a promise to use reasonable efforts to bring profits and revenues into existence, and, hence, the demurrer cannot be sustained.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>

- **Class Discussion**
  - π Claim: ∆ gave her endorsement to other products without any compensation.

  - Consideration: Exclusive rights to market products X for 1/2 profits made from sales of endorsed products.
  - Cardozo "The law has outgrown is primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was the sovereign talisman and every slip was fatal.” The clear intent of the parties was to give the plaintiff an exclusive right. The defendant cannot escape that right on a formal technicality."
  - Cannot account for profits if you dont have a duty to make profits
    - Implied promise to create profits that will be accounted for monthly.
  - The opposite holding? What is a reasonable effort by the π to create profits?
    - What happens if he does not generate profits?
    - What remedy does ∆ have?
  - Cardozo enforcing contract that was not explicitly between the parties, (Freedom to make bad deals)
    - Cardozo reading intent into contract and not reading the contract as it was written.

#### Uniform Commerical Code §1-304 - Obligation of Good Faith
- Every contract or duty within the UCC imposes an *obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement*.


#### Uniform Commerical Code §2-306(2)
- A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use *best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale*
- Terms dealing with expected output, requirements, and exclusive dealings must be followed in good faith.
  - Requirements contract: a seller agrees to provide as much of a good as the buyer requires
  - Output contract: a buyer agrees to buy all of a seller’s output.
- Traditionally, “courts often refused to enforce requirements contracts where the buyer could choose to have no requirements.” But both parties shrunk their realm of choice, so there was mutual consideration.
  - “ . . . a modern court would almost certainly hold that all requirements and output contracts have consideration.”


#### Mutuality of Obligation
- As long as there is **sufficient consideration**, unequal (lack of mutality) terms do not invalidate a contract.


#### Case: *[Weiner v. McGraw-Hill, Inc.](Link)*

    <li><b>Overview:</b> A former employee stated a cause of action in contract where he alleged that his former employer discharged him without sufficient cause or rehabilitation attempts, in violation of an employment agreement.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π entered upon a career in book publishing with another employer & was invited to engage in discussions looking towards his joining the staff of ∆. ∆ representative assured π of company's firm policy not to terminate employees without "just cause". Employment with ∆ would bring him job security. π signed McGraw form where specified that π would be subject to the provisions of handbook on personnel policies and procedures. π forfeited fringe benefits and salary increase that were to induce him to remain at current employ so as to take job with ∆ company. π worked for 8 years at ∆ company and was raised in his level of compensation and rank. He suddenly found himself discharged for "lack of application" π seeks damages for wrongful termination.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the π though not engaged for a fixed term of employment, pleaded a good cause of action for breach of contract against his employer.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Mutuality in the sense of requiring such reciprocity is not necessary when a promisor receives other valid considerations. Court found sufficient evidence of a contact and a breach to sustain a cause of action. π was induced to leave previous employment with assurance that ∆ would not discharge him without cause. Second, assurance was incorporated into the employment application. Third π rejected other offers of employment in reliance on the assurance. Fourth appellant alleged that when he had recommendend certain subordinates be dismissed he was instructed to proceed in strict compliance with handbook and policy because employees could be discharged only for just cause. If he did not comply with handbook, ∆ would be liable for legal action. Therefore factors combine to present a question, was ∆ bound to a promise not to discharge π without just and sufficient cause and an opportunity for rehabilitation. Order reversed.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
- No mutality but contract is still enforcable.
  - This is a problem
    - Employer gave up his "at-will" status by inducing π to leave his job.
      - **Inducing someone to leave job = Bargain for consideration**
- **Case Examples**
  - *Kamboj v. Eli Lilly & Co*
    - Absent special circumstances, mere relinquishment of a prior job to take a new job is insufficient consideration. **But** *if the employee's forbearance is a "specifically bargained for detriment" it can be said that the employee has surrendered something of value in exchange for the promise of employment and therefore that adequate consideration exists.*



#### Case: *[Mattei v. Hopper](Link)*

- Satisfaction clauses constitute consideration when courts read them as requiring good faith. Otherwise, the satisfaction clause would not involve a commitment, so the promise would be illusory.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> π brought action for damages after ∆ breached a contract by failing to convey her real property in accordance with terms of a deposit receipt which the parties had executed.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π real estate developer was planning to construct a shopping center on a tract of ∆ land. After many attempts ∆ accepted π offer to buy land. π was given 120 days to examine the title and consummate the purchase after deposting $1000. Concluding clause provided that purchase contingent on Coldwell Banker & Co. obtaining leases satisfactory to the purchaser. 120 days and clause as means for arranging satisfactory leases of the shopping center building prior to the time he was finally committed to pay the balance of the purchase price and to take title to ∆ property. While π was in process of securing leases, ∆ attorney notified π that ∆ would not sell her land under terms contained in the deposit receipt. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the deposit receipt no more than an offer by her which could only be accepted by π notifying her that all of the desired leases had been obtained and were satifactory to him.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To make a contract where promises are exchanged as consideration, the promises must be mutual in obligation. Both much have assumed some legal obligations.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> ∆ thesis that deposit is no more than an offer must be rejected. The whole purhcase receipt and particular cluase must be read as merely making πs performance dependent on the obtaining of "satisfactory" leases. A contract arose, and π was given the power and privilege to terminate it in the event he did not obtain such leases. Accords with general view that deposit receipts are binding and enoforceable contracts. </li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
- Consideration: π to buy property and ∆ to sell property
  - π is conditional based on **satisfactory** lease obtained
  - ∆ no consideration and lacked mutality of obliation.
  - A promise to sell along with a promise to buy forms a contract under the conditions.
    - Problem arises when one party does not perform under the duties of the contract.
  - ∆ argues that the satisfaction clause (satifactory leases) makes the mutuality agreement of the π illusory. π can pull out of deal and has no obligation. Invalid promise if they can choose to do or not do the obligation.
  - Court held that satisfaction clause was performed in "good faith"


#### Satisfaction Clauses
- Promise with condition that promisor is "**satisfied**"
- Good faith obligation means that your decision about whether you are satisfied must be reasonable or honest.
- Satisfaction clauses constitute consideration when courts read them as requiring good faith. Otherwise, the satisfaction clause would not involve a commitment, so the promise would be illusory.
- If satisfaction clause deals with "commercial value or quality, operative fitness or mechanical utility" courts generally apply reasonableness test.
  - Satisfaction as compared with other market alternatives.
- If satisfaction deals with "fancy, taste, or judgement" courts apply the honesty test.
- **Limitation** placed on "free way to backout" is not an illusory promise.
  - **Limitation = "sufficient notice"**
    - 24 hour notice
    - Written Notice
    - Any Notice


- Corbin on Contracts: A promise conditional upon the promisor's satisfaction is not illusory since it means more than the validity of the performance is to depend on the arbitary choice of the promisor.


#### The Preexisting Duty Doctrine
- Performance of an existing duty is not consideration.
  - Neither the performance of duty nor the promise to render a performance already required by duty is a sufficient consideration for a return promise.
- Contract Modification
  - Accord & Satisfaction
- Withholding performance does not create consideration for a modification. It looks more like extortion.


- Case Examples
  - *Haigh v. Brooks*
    - Giving up a piece of paper, however objectively worthless it may have been would be consideration.
- **Corbin on Contracts**
  - Parting with a document, contents which render no service, has been held to be a consideration for a promise to pay a large sum of money.


- Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 79 (PepperCorn)
  - Adequacy of Consideration

    - Unconscionable Contract or Term
      - **Note to Examine Later**


### 3.6 Obligation Arising From Justified Reliance - Promissory Estoppel
- A moral obligation to keep a promise is generally insufficient to establish a legal obligation.
- Lawmakers should also consider social policy and experiential concerns (e.g., problems of proof)
- Injury from reliance is a moral and policy reason for enforcing promises.

#### No Reliance in Traditional Common Law

#### Case: *[Kirksey v. Kirksey](Link)*
- These facts are analogous to the tramp example. Was this a mere gift or was there consideration? The defendant got nothing in return for his offer, but the plaintiff did do what he wanted—so you can start the consideration analysis.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The defendant, plaintiff’s brother in law, invited the plaintiff and her family to come live at his house, offering her living space and land to tend, but asking nothing in return. She abandoned her property in the country to come live with him. He let her live comfortably in the house for two years. Then, he put her in a house, “not comfortable,” in the woods, and then made her leave.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Would an action lie for breach of the promise?</li>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Consideration: ∆ asked π to come live on his land and promises housing. No bargain for exchange.
    - ∆ Promise: Induced π to leave her own home to move

  - Opinion: Ormond seeks to correct injustice.
    - π sustained breaking up and moving to ∆s property

#### Restatement Second § 90: Promise Reasonably Inducing Action or Forbearance
1. “A promise which **the promisor should reasonably expect** *to induce action or forbearance* on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding **if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise**. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.”

- Under classical contract law, only a bargain was consideration. Donative promises were not enforceable, even if the promisee relied on the promise. *Kirksey*.

#### Estoppel in pais (or equitable estoppel):
- If A made a statement and B foreseeably relied on that statement, A is estopped from denying that statement’s truth. Based on a statement of fact.
  - For instance, say a store receives a suspicious check. It calls the owner of the bank account to make sure it’s valid. The owner absent-mindedly said yes, but the check was in fact a forgery. The customer is estopped from denying the truth of his statement.
- Case Basis - *Ricketts v. Cothorn*
  - Holding: Having intentionally influenced the π to alter her position for the worse on the faith of the note being paid when due, it would be grossly inequitable to permit the maker, or his executor, to resist payment on the ground that the promise was given without consideration.


#### Promissory estoppel:
- A promise is binding if the promisee reasonably relied on it. Codified in Restatement Second § 90. Based on a promise.

#### Reliance Principle
- Both are instances of a broader “reliance principle”: “When one person, A, uses words or actions that he knows or should know would induce another, B, to reasonably believe that A is committed to take a certain course of action, and A knows or should know that B will incur costs if A doesn’t take action, A should take steps to ensure that if he doesn’t take the action, B will not suffer a loss.”

#### Case: *[Wheeler v. White](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The existence of promises designedly made to influence and encourage the conduct of petitioner did not make a contract, but estopped respondent from insisting on strict construction of contractual terms.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner entered into a contract whereby respondent was to obtain a loan for petitioner within six months of the date of the contract. The loan described the contract terms and provided that respondent was to be paid for obtaining the loan and receive a commission on all rentals received from tenants procured by petitioner. After the contract had been signed by both parties, respondent assured petitioner that the money would be available and urged him to proceed with the necessary task of demolishing the building on the site for construction of the new building. Pursuant to such promises, petitioner proceeded to raze the old building and prepare the land for the new structure. No loan was procured and respondent refused to provide one. The court found that although the terms of the contract itself lacked sufficiency, petitioner's alternative pleadings on the theory of estoppel stated a cause of action.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the trial court err in sustaining the special exceptions directed at the sufficiency of the contract itself, instead of considering the doctrine of promissory estoppel?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise."</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed and remanded the case for trial, finding that although the terms of the contract itself lacked sufficiency, petitioner's alternative pleadings on the theory of estoppel stated a cause of action. The binding thread which runs through the cases applying promissory estoppel is the existence of promises designedly made to influence the conduct of the promisee, tacitly encouraging the conduct, which conduct, although not necessarily constituting any actual performance of the contract itself, is something that must be done by the promisee before he could begin to perform, and was a fact known to the promisor.</li>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>  In a breach of contract action injustice would result if plaintiffs were not granted some relief where defendants failed to keep their promises that had induced plaintiffs to act to their detriment.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Red Owl promised a couple that if they invested a total sum of $ 18,000, Red Owl would establish a new grocery store for them. Upon reliance to the agreement and representations, the couple sold their bakery building and business and their grocery store and business, as well as bought a new lot, only to find Red Owl continuously increased the price the parties had originally agreed upon. Consequently, the couple were induced to sell the store's fixtures and inventory on the promise that they would be in their new store in a few months. The deal never went through and couple sued Red Owl. The circuit court ruled in favour of the couple. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the couple have a cause of action based on promissory estoppel?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The conditions imposed for promissory estoppel are: (1) Was the promise one which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee? (2) Did the promise induce such action or forbearance? (3) Can injustice be avoided only by enforcement of the promise?</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Courts held that the development of the law of promissory estoppel is an attempt by the courts to keep remedies abreast of increased moral consciousness of honesty and fair representations in all business dealings. A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.</li>

#### Case: *[Local 1330, United Steel Workers v. United States Steel Corp.](Link)*
- If an employer promises its employees to continue running its business IF it is profitable, the promisor can abandon the business if it is not profitable without sustaining liability based on promissory estoppel.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> If an employer promises its employees to continue running its business IF it is profitable, the promisor can abandon the business if it is not profitable without sustaining liability based on promissory estoppel.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellants, steel workers union and individual employees, filed suit against appellee steel corporation to enjoin appellees' closing of two major steel plants or in the alternative, to require appellees to sell the steel plants to appellants. Appellants claimed that pursuant to an agreement with appellees, if the plants were made profitable, appellees would keep the plants open or sell them to appellants. The district court denied all relief, holding that appellants had not met the condition precedent of making the plants profitable. On appeal, appellants asserted that the district court erred in its factual findings, in denying a hearing on the antitrust claims, and in construing the applicable law.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Were the trial court's factual findings erroneous?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The appellate court's standard of review of findings of fact of the district court is set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a), which provides, findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed, holding that the district court's factual findings were not clearly erroneous because there was evidence to support appellees' decision that the plants **were not profitable** and appellants had failed to prove otherwise. The court held that appellants had failed to provide any legal basis to support a injunction requiring appellees to continue the plant operations. The court vacated and remanded the order dismissing appellants' antitrust claim.</li>

### 3.7 Obligation Arising From Unjust Enrichment

#### Restatement (Third) of Restitution § 1
- A person who is unjustly enriched at the expense of another is subject to liability in restitution.
- Remedy = **Restiution**
#### Implied-in-Law and Implied-in-Fact Contracts
- **Implied-in-fact** contracts are true contracts in which assent is implied without any expressed contract.
not explicit— e.g., raising your hand to bid at an auction.
- **Implied-in-law** contracts aren’t really contracts. There’s no offer, acceptance, or assent. But to prevent unjust enrichment, someone should be rewarded.
- Implied-in-fact contracts: the parties decide that there is a contract v. Implied-in-law: the court decides
- “Contracts implied in law, or as they are more commonly called ‘quasi contracts,’ are obligations imposed by law on grounds of justice and equity. Their purpose is to prevent unjust enrichment. Unlike express contracts or contracts implied in fact, quasi contracts do not rest upon the assent of the contracting parties.
- Gardner, “Observations in the Course of Contracts”
  - Four principles underly ethical problems in contracts
    - The Tort Idea: promisor must pay for losses from promisee’s reliance.
    - The Bargain Idea: buyer must pay the agreed price to the seller.
    - The Promissory Idea: promises are inherently binding.
    - The Quasi-Contractual Idea: anyone who receives anything of value should pay for it unless it’s a gift

- No Promise or Agreement/Bargain-For Exchange = No Contract
- No evidence of any inference or implied-in-fact
- Perhaps theory of Quasi-Contract Idea could be applicable
  - Conferral of a Benefit in the Absence of a Contract

    - π bringing claim for "finders fee" not for the oral agreement "something for my business"
- Counter Argument
  - In Business people do not normally conduct this type of business without some benefit.
    - Realestate development customarily has a "broker fee"
    - Mere action of asking π what he expects to get means that ∆ thought of πs expectation
  - Perhaps enough evidence to go infront of the jury.

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Where a businessman never indicated that he expected a finder's fee for his introduction of defendants who later began an enterprise to develop waterfront property, he could not recover a fee under an implied-in-fact contract or a quasi-contract.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π Bloomgarden sought a finder's fee for a Georgetown realestate deal for $1 million dollars. π alleged he was entitled to remuneration by virtue of a contract which should either be factually implied from prevalent custom and usage or recognized as a legal consequence of the transaction when viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether π was entitiled to a finders fee as an implied in fact contract</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> It is well settled that in order to establish an implied-in-fact contract to pay for services, the party seeking payment must show: 1. that the services were carried out under such circumstances as to give the recipient reason to understand that: a. they were performed for him and not for some other person, and b. that they were not rendered gratuitously, but with the expectation of compensation from the recipient; and 2. that the services were beneficial to the recipient</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Held that because π did not hold the license required of real estate and businesschance brokers in the DC area, he was precluded from charging for what he did. Further, no enforceable claim for recompense because it appeared without dispute that at the time he introduced the parties he did not expect to be personally compensated for doing so. π did not indicate he wanted payment, therefore no unjust reasonable expectation of payment on part of ∆. Instead looks more like a gift (gratuitous intent)</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> The trial court did not err in awarding the manager damages under an unjust enrichment theory because, although the complaint did not clearly encompass the theory, it was tried with the express or implied consent of the executor.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff manager alleged a breach of an oral contract by the defendant executor and estate and later filed an amended complaint, which alleged that plaintiff was entitled to recover for funds and services that he expended on the building under an equitable lien theory.

#### Remedies in Implied-in-Law and Implied-in-Fact
- Implied-in-fact contracts are based on the parties’ intentions, so the proper remedy is compensatory damages.
  - One who has conferred a benefit upon another with an intention to make a gift, has no equitable claim for relief against the recipent of the benefit in the absence of fraud, mistake, duress or undue influence.
  - One who confers a benefit upon another without affording that other the opporunity to reject the benefit, has no equitable claim for relief against the recipient of the benefit in the absence of some special policy that would outweigh the right of free choice in the benefited party.
  - Implied-in-law contracts are based on unjust enrichment, so the proper remedy is the value of the benefit acquired.
  - Damages in an unjust enrichment (i.e., implied in law) claim are measured by the benefit conferred. Damages in a quantum meruit claim are measured by the reasonable value of the plaintiff’s services.

#### Gift Principle and the Choice Principle
- One who confers a benefit upon another without affording the other the opportunity to reject the benefit has no equitable claim for releift against the recipient of the benefit in the absence of some special policy that would outweigh the right of free choice in the benefited party.
- There are situations in which the policy is outweighed by other considerations, but the basic principle is solidly established.

#### Services between siblings
- Brown v. Brown
  - Substantial policy considerations underlie the presumption that services **rendered between siblings/family members are gratuitous**.
    - As a matter of common human experience

#### Case: *[Gay v. Mooney](Link)*

  - Failed contact in writing demonstrates a bargain-for-exchange
  - Only remedy was the services rendered not the full house or value of the full house.

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Recovery to a contractor was improper where the contractor willfully abandoned the contract without justification because recovery for benefits conferred was proper only when there was justification for the deviation from the original contract.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The property owner entered into a contract with the contractor to excavate dirt. After partial performance, the contractor abandoned all work. The contractor then filed a complaint to recover the value of services rendered before the contractor abandoned performance. Judgment was entered in favor of the contractor.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the lower court was correct that π can recover under unjust enrichment after materially breaching contract?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Recovery can be had for partial performance which has been beneficial only when the benefit has been appropriated by the defendant under circumstances sufficient to raise an implied promise to pay for the reasonable value of what has been received. There can ordinarily be no recovery where the contractor has wilfully abandoned his contract without justification.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the rule permitting recovery for partial performance was only applicable where the part performance was justified. **The court held that the contractor willfully abandoned the contract and was not entitled to recover for benefits conferred on the property owner**. π cannot recover.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Court affirmed jury verdict in favor of plaintiff's compensation claim because defendant actually received the labor, and thereby derived a benefit so as to be responsible for compensating for the labor actually performed.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> This is a case for breach of contract for labour. Plaintiff agreed to perform work based on certain declarations in exchange for a hundred and twenty dollar compensation from Defendant. The term of the contract is one year from March 1831 but Plaintiff voluntarily terminated his service on December. Plaintiff demanded a reasonable sum for partially performing the service under the principle of quantum meruit. Defendant contended that the service was performed under a special contract, and since plaintiff agreed to work for one year, he is not entitled to recover any thing for failing without good cause to serve the term of the contract. After trial, the jury was satisfied that Plaintiff was entitled to a reasonable value of his service. Defendant appealed a jury award in favor of plaintiff.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether π can recover a reasonable sum for the services he has actually performed, under the count in quantum meruit?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The hired laborer shall be entitled to compensation for the service actually performd, though he do not continue the entire term contracted for, and such contracts must be presumed to made with reference to that understanding, unless an express stipulation shows the contrary. If in a failure to perform a whole contract, the nature of the contract be such that the employer can reject what has been done, and refuse to receive any benefit from the part performance, he is entitled so to do, and in such case is not liable to be charged unless he has before assented to and accepted of what has been done, however much the other party may have done towards the performance. The employer has in such case received nothing, and having contracted to receive nothing but the entire matter contracted for, he is not bound to pay because his express promise was only to pay on receiving the whole. **But where the party receives value--takes and uses the materials, or has advantage from the labor, he is liable to pay the reasonable worth of what he has received.**</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The π was entitled to recover as much as the labor performed was reasonably worth, and the jury appear to have allowed a pro rata compensation, for the time which the π labored in the ∆s service. The court affirmed the jury verdict, holding that defendant actually received the labor and thereby derived a benefit and advantage so as to be responsible for compensating for the labor actually performed. The labor actually performed furnished new consideration, and the law required a promise to pay to the extent of the reasonable worth of such labor in excess of the damage caused by the breach of contract. The court further stated that if defendant actually sustained damages from plaintiff's failure to complete his contract he would be able to recover in a suit for breach of contract.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Appellee defaulting purchaser's right for restitution did not arise upon his breach of contract standing alone; it arose when appellants rejected vendors' remedies at law and abandoned the contract for all purposes.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellants and appellee entered into a written contract wherein appellee agreed to purchase a tract of land from appellants. Terms regarding amount, manner, and due dates were specifically contracted. Appellee never made a payment on time and failed to render final payment in compliance with the terms of the contract.

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Judgment dismissing female cohabitant's suit against male cohabitant was properly reversed because female cohabitant stated a claim upon which relief could be granted that could rest upon a breach of contract, unjust enrichment, or partition theory.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> The parties' 12-year nonmarital cohabitation relationship produced 2 children. The court held that the female stated a claim upon which relief could be granted that could rest on a contract, unjust enrichment, or partition theory. Neither the Wisconsin Family Code nor public policy precluded the female from asserting an express or implied contractual right to share property accumulated through the parties' joint efforts. The female could raise an unjust enrichment claim in view of the male's alleged unreasonable retention of the parties' jointly acquired property. Facts about the parties' business partnership, joint property purchases, and the female's uncompensated home and business contributions stated a partition claim, which was a proper cause of action in marital cohabitation cases.</li>

    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether π could recover based on an implied in fact cohabitation relationship or based on an unjust enrichment doctrine of implied in law for her cohabitation of 12 years with her "husband"</li>

    <li><b>Rule:</b> Unmarried cohabitants may raise claims based upon unjust enrichment following the termination of their relationships where one of the parties attempts to retain an unreasonable amount of the property acquired through the efforts of both. A claim of unjust enrichment does not arise out of an agreement entered into by unmarried cohabiting parties. An action for recovery based upon unjust enrichment is grounded on the moral principle that one who has received a benefit has a duty to make restitution where retaining such a benefit would be unjust. In Wisconsin, an action for unjust enrichment, or quasi contract, is based upon proof of three elements: (1) a benefit conferred on the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and (3) acceptance or retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances making it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit. </li>

    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The judgment that dismissed the female's action against the male for an accounting and a share of the personal and business assets accumulated during the parties' unmarried cohabitation relationship was reversed. The female stated a claim for which relief could be granted and her claim could rest on contract, unjust enrichment, or partition grounds.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b>Levy Wyman fell ill in Hartford on return from a voyage from sea. The plaintiff, Daniel Mills, housed him at his expense for 15 days, at which point Wyman died. Wyman’s father promised to pay Mills’s expenses. When Wyman’s father failed to pay, Mills sued. The trial court directed a nonsuit.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The general position, that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration for an express promise, is to be limited in its application, to cases where a good or valuable consideration has once existed.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> There was no consideration in the defendant’s promise to pay Mills. Moral obligation is insufficient without consideraion. “ . . . if there was nothing paid or promised for it, the law, perhaps wisely, leaves the execution of it to the conscience of him who makes it. It is only when the party making the promise gains something, or he to whom it is made loses something, that the law gives the promise validity.”</li>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Injury to plaintiff in saving promisor's life was sufficient legal consideration to enforce the subsequently deceased promisor's promise to pay an amount periodically from defendants for the remainder of plaintiff's life.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Webb worked in a lumber company. He was pushing heavy wooden blocks off a ledge. As he was pushing a block, he noticed that McGowin was below. The only way he could prevent the block from crushing McGowin was to fall with it, so he did, and sustained serious injuries and suffered permanent disabilities. McGowin promised to pay Webb $15 every two weeks for the rest of Webb’s life, until McGowin died a few years later. McGowin’s executors refused to keep paying. Webb brought suit</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether a promisee cares for, improves, and preserves the property of the promisor, though done without his request, is it a sufficient consideration for the promisor’s subsequent agreement to pay for the service because of the material benefit received?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> “Where the promisee cares for, improves, and preserves the property of the promisor, though done without his request, it is sufficient consideration for the promisor’s subsequent agreement to pay for the service, because of the material benefit received.”</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> McGowin's express promise to pay appellant for the services rendered was an affirmance or ratification of what appellant had done raising the presumption that the services had been rendered at McGowin's request.The averments of the complaint show that in saving McGowin from death or grievous bodily harm, appellant was crippled for life. This was part of the consideration of the contract declared on. McGowin was benefited. Appellant was injured. Benefit to the promisor or injury to the promisee is a sufficient legal consideration for the promisor's agreement to pay. McGowin’s promise was therefore enforceable.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Judgment in favor of a tenant was proper where a subsequent promise of an owner to pay the tenant the reasonable value for digging, and casing a well was binding and supported by sufficient consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> After the tenant drilled a well upon the premises, the owner, in consideration of the well to him, allegedly ratified the acts of the tenant in having the well drilled and agreed to pay the tenant for the reasonable value for digging the well. Thereafter, the tenant filed an action against the owner to enforce the promise. The trial court, upon a jury verdict, rendered judgment in favor of the tenant. The owner appealed. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the subsequent promise of the owner to pay the tenant the reasonable value for digging and casing the well was binding and supported by sufficient consideration?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Past services are not a sufficient consideration for a promise to pay therefor, made at a subsequent time, and after such services have been fully rendered and completed; however, a moral obligation, founded on previous benefits received by the promisor at the hands of the promisee, will support a promise by him. </li>

- Consideration = Promise to pay for a benefit that was previously received.
- ∆ Benefit Receieved = Dug well
- π Benefit Conferred = Work + Time in digging well.

- **Moral Obligation**
  - Past services are not a sufficient consideration for a promise to pay therefor, made at a subsequent time, and after such services have been fully rendered and completed; however, a moral obligation, founded on previous benefits received by the promisor at the hands of the promisee, will support a promise by him. (Legal Fiction?)

- **Sufficient Consideration**
  - An express promise for past services rendered without previous request is supported by a sufficient consideration if the services were beneficial, and were not intended to be gratuitous.
  - An act done for the benefit of another without his request is deemed a voluntary act of courtesy, for which no action can be sustained, unless after knowing of the service the person benefited thereby promises to pay for it. **However, if the consideration, even without request, moves directly from plaintiff to defendant, and inures directly to defendant's benefit, the promise is binding though made upon a past consideration.**

### Restatement of Contracts §86
#### Promise for Benefit Receieved
1. A promise made in recognition of a benefit previously recieved by the promisor from the promisee is binding to the extent necessary **to prevent injustice** (courts subjective) (oh boy)
2. A promise is not binding under Subsection (1):
  1. IF the promisee conferred the benefit as a gift or for other reasons the promisor has not been unjustly enriched;
  2. To the extent that its value is disproportionate to the benefit.
##### Comments:
- Past Consideration: The mere fact of promise has been thought to create a moral obligation, but it is clear that not all promises are enforced. Nor are moral obligations based solely on gratitude or sentiment sufficient of themselves to support a subsequent promise.
- Rationale: In other cases restitution is denied by virtue of rules designed to guard against false claims, stale claims, claims already litigated, and the like.
- **Examination of Facts**
  - Facts such has the definite and substantial character of the benefit received, formality in the making of the promise, part performance of the promise, reliance on the promise, or the probability of such reliance may be relevant to show that no impositon results from enforcement.

### Obligation Arising From A Statutory Warranty

#### Case: *[Keith v. Buchanan](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>  A sales brochure that represented that a boat was seaworthy was an express warranty and was presumptively part of the basis of the agreement between the buyer and seller of a boat.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff buyer purchased a boat from defendant sellers after he reviewed the representations in the sales brochure and spoke with sales representatives. After the boat was delivered, a dispute arose as to the seaworthiness of the boat. Plaintiff brought suit and alleged a breach of an express warranty and breach of an implied warranty. The trial court dismissed the action at the close of plaintiff's case and held that there was no express warranty and there was no implied warranty of fitness. The buyer sought review to the Court of Appeal of California.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Are the sellers liable for express warranties? 1. Whether the seller's statements contitutute an affirmation of fact or promise, or description of the goods under CA UCC, or whether it is rather merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods under section. 2. Assuming the court finds the language used susceptible to creation of a warranty it must then be determined whether the statement was part of the basis of the bargain. 3. Court must determine whether the warranty was breached. </li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> An implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises only where (1) the purchaser at the time of contracting intends to use the goods for a particular purpose, (2) the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know of this particular purpose, (3) the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish goods suitable for the particular purpose, and (4) the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know that the buyer is relying on such skill and judgment. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that the representations regarding the boat's seaworthiness made in sales brochures were affirmations of fact relating to the quality or condition of the vessel. The court stated that a warranty statement made by defendants was presumptively part of the basis of the bargain, and defendants carried the burden to prove that bargain did not rest on the representation. The court held defendants failed to overcome this burden. However, the court affirmed the trial court's holding that there was no implied warranty of fitness because there was substantial evidence that plaintiff did not rely on the skill or judgment defendants in the selection of the vessel in question.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> The presence of a fish bone in fish chowder should reasonably have been anticipated and guarded against by plaintiff, a restaurant customer, and was not a breach of implied warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff was injured when a fish bone lodged in her throat while dining at defendant's restaurant. An action to recover damages for personal injuries was sustained by reason of a breach of implied warranty related to food served in defendant's restaurant. The trial court found for plaintiff. Defendant appealed and asserted that New England fish chowder is a hearty dish, and no chef should be asked to reduce the pieces of fish to miniscule size in an effort to ascertain if they contained any pieces of bone.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was there a breach of implied warranty that plaintiff entitled to damages?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The possible presence of a piece of oyster shell in or attached to an oyster is so well known to anyone who eats oysters that the court can say as a matter of law that one who eats oysters can reasonably anticipate and guard against eating such a piece of shell.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court found no breach of implied warranty because a restaurant customer such as plaintiff, eating fish chowder, should have anticipated having to remove some fish bones from her bowl. The court even reviewed the history of fish chowder and found no recipes that instructed the cook to ensure that the fish was bone-free. Therefore, the bone which injured plaintiff did not impair the fish chowder's fitness or merchantability. The court sustained defendant's exceptions and entered judgment for defendant.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff creditors provided professional services to a business in which defendant debtor held a large interest. They maintained that he personally guaranteed payment. Defendant argued that if there was such an agreement, it was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether ∆s promise fell within the statute of frauds and required a written contract?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Whether or not the Statute of Frauds will apply is then to depend upon whether this consideration was mainly desired for the promisor's benefit or for the benefit of the original debtor. In applying this rule the finder of fact must examine all circumstances bearing upon the transaction, the relationship of the parties to one another and endeavor to discern the intent, purpose and object of the promisor. In undertaking this examination the nature of the consideration will be of great if not paramount importance.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the intermediate appellate court's judgment and reinstated the trial court's judgment in favor of plaintiff creditors in their action to recover monies owed by defendant debtor. The court held that the parties' agreement was not within the Statute of Frauds because defendant's promise to guarantee payment of plaintiffs' services furthered his own pecuniary interests.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Judgment for former employee for employer's breach of a one-year oral employment contract was appropriate because former employee's reliance was such that injustice could only be avoided by enforcement of the contract.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant employer challenged a decision entering judgment for plaintiff former employee in an action for breach of a one-year oral employment contract. Plaintiff moved 2200 miles from Los Angeles to Hawaii to take the job and was fired prior to the end of the one-year contractual term. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can injustice be avoided only by enforcement of the promise?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce the action or forbearance is enforceable notwithstanding the statute of frauds if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach is to be limited as justice requires. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> In determining whether injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise, the following circumstances are significant: (a) the availability and adequacy of other remedies, particularly cancellation and restitution; (b) the definite and substantial character of the action or forbearance in relation to the remedy sought; (c) the extent to which the action or forbearance corroborates evidence of the making and terms of the promise, or the making and terms are otherwise established by clear and convincing evidence; (d) the reasonableness of the action or forbearance; (e) the extent to which the action or forbearance was forseeable by the promisor. There is no dispute that the action of the plaintiff in moving 2200 miles from Los Angeles to Hawaii was foreseeable by the defendant. In fact, it was required to perform his duties. The enforcement of the contract and the granting of money damages can only avoid injustice. No other remedy is adequate.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> A man and a corporation entered into a lease contract whereby the corporation agreed to remove sand and gravel and leave the property at a uniform grade, substantially the same as the grade that existed at the roadway. The corporation deliberately breached the contract by removing the richest and best of the gravel and failed to perform and comply with the terms of the lease. The lessor filed a case for breach of contract but was disappointed with the sum that he received for his claim. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the trial courts determination of damages proper?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Even in case of substantial performance in good faith, the resulting defects being remediable, it is error to instruct that the measure of damages is the difference in the value between the house as it was and as it would have been if constructed according to contract. The correct doctrine is that the cost of remedying the defect is the proper measure of damages.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that a new trial was in order because the cost of remedying the defect was the amount awarded in compensation for failure to render the promised performance. The defendants were liable to the plaintiff for the reasonable cost of doing what the defendants promised to do and willfully declined to do.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee homeowner contracted for appellant contractor to put a new roof on his residence. Appellant began work but never finished the job. Appellee contracted with a roofing company to have the work completed. The cost of the company’s work was $ 357.26 more than the amount of appellant’s contract. Appellee sued appellant for the difference alleging breach of contract. The trial court entered judgment in appellee’s favor. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the judgment with instructions to grant a new trial on the issues of damages.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the trial court err in awarding appellee homeowner damages representing the difference between the contract price with appellant contractor and the amount paid to the roofing company for the completion of the work?</li>

Damages are awarded for the purpose of compensation and the injured party shall not be placed in a better position than he would have been in had no breach occurred. In such cases, the successful plaintiff shall only be allowed to recover what it has cost him to complete the same work, over and above the original contract price.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> There was no error in the finding that appellant contractor had breached the contract. However, the trial court erred in holding that the two contracts were substantially the same and that the damages were the amount that the roofing company's contract exceeded the appellant's price. The evidence clearly showed that appellee homeowner had received more from the roofing company than he was to have received from appellant. Thus, an improper measure of damages was applied.</li>

#### Case: *[Handicapped Children's Education Board of Sheboygan County v. Lukaszweski](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A teacher, who resigned for reasons other than her health, breached her employment contract with the school board, and the board was entitled to recover damages sustained by having to hire a more qualified replacement at a higher rate of pay.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant teacher resigned before her contract with the plaintiff school board expired, claiming that health problems prevented her continued employment. The board was forced to hire a more qualified replacement at a higher rate of pay. The board brought an action for breach of contract and the trial court awarded damages, finding that the teacher had breached her contract because she resigned for reasons other than her health. The appellate court affirmed that part of the decision but revered the damages, finding that the board suffered no damage for the breach. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> May an employee's purported health condition be excuse for her breach of employment contract where the health condition was brought about by her conduct?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Damages in breach of contract cases are ordinarily measured by the expectations of the parties. The nonbreaching party is entitled to full compensation for the loss of his or her bargain, that is, losses necessarily following from the breach which are proven to a reasonable certainty and were within contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The trial court's findings of fact, specifically those that indicated that Defendant teacher's health problems were a result of the stress condition she had created by an attempted repudiation of her contract and that she had resigned for reasons other than her health, were not against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence. When more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the credible evidence, the reviewing court must accept the inference drawn by the trier of fact.  Damages for breach of contract are measured by the expectations of the parties. The Board expected to receive the services of a speech therapist with the teacher's education and experience at the salary agreed upon. It neither expected nor wanted a more experienced therapist who had to be paid an additional $ 1,026.64 per year. The teacher's breach forced the Board to hire the replacement and, in turn, to pay a higher salary. Therefore, the Board lost the benefit of its bargain.</li>

#### Case: *[Tongish v. Thomas](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The correct method of calculating damages for breach of sales contract was the difference between market price and contract price because it was a more specific statutory remedy that controlled over the general damage provision.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee seller had a contract to sell sunflower seeds to appellant cooperative. Appellee delivered a portion of the seeds, but when the market price of sunflower seeds doubled, he stopped delivering to appellant and sold the seeds to defendant buyer. Defendant paid appellee for approximately one-half of the seeds and appellant filed an action to collect the balance. Appellant intervened in the action, seeking damages for breach of contract. The trial court awarded damages to appellant based on its loss of expected profits. The intermediate appellate court reversed, holding that the difference between market price and contract price was the proper measure of damages pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. § 84-2-713 because it was more specific than the general damages provision of Kan. Stat. Ann. § 54-1-106. On appeal, the court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the difference between market price and contract price the proper measure of damages?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The market damages remedy as contained in Kan. Stat. Ann. § 84-2-713 should be followed as the preferred measure of damages. While application of the rule may not reflect the actual loss to a buyer, it encourages a more efficient market and discourages the breach of contracts. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The difference in market price and contract price was the correct method of measuring intervenor's damages. In addition to adopting the intermediate court's rationale, it held that damages computed under § 84-2-713 encouraged the honoring of contracts and market stability.</li>

#### Substantive Bases of Contract Liability

-Common law recognizes several general theories of obligation.
-Recognized basis for imposing legal duties.
-Predominant theory is that legal duties arise from a valid agreement with consideration (a contract)
  - Agreement = Two or more persons have expressed themselves in harmony
  - Consideration = as a bargained for exchange
- Other Forms of agreements
  - Standard form agreements
    - Majority of contracts made
      - Routine Transactions to Leases, deeds, mortages
    - Provide information and enforce order
    - One of the beliefs by which our society is organized, is that at least some lawmaking is better accomplished in a decentralized manner.
  - Oral Agreements
  - Informal Agreements
-Relational Exchange
  - Discrete = Little interaction between the parties
  - Relational = Occuring through time in a process of continuous interaction between parties.
    - The more relational an exchange the more it is projected into the future, the more likely the parties and their lawyers will be unable to adance to define performance obligations with precision or to allocate risks optimally.
      - May relay on norms to govern their relation other than those arising from the original agreement.
- Social Resources that Facilitate agreements and their Performance
  - Specialization o labor, results in a need for exchange behavior. As individuals specializ, they become lesss self-sufficient and more dependent on other's goods and services which they must secure through agreements.
- Institutional Aspects
  - Exchange by Tradition (Manor)
  - Exchange by Authority (Army)
- Theories of Obligation
- Remedies
