## 1.0 Introduction to Contracts

- Deal with the Devil
  - Basic contract law principles. One party wants something right away the other must wait.
  - Take the future effectively make it the present by contract
- [Nick Szabo on Contracts](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)
  - The contract, a set of promises agreed to in a "meeting of the minds", is the traditional way to formalize a relationship.
  - Whether enforced by a government, or otherwise, the contract is the basic building block of a free market economy. Over many centuries of cultural evolution has emerged both the concept of contract and principles related to it, encoded into common law.

### 1.1 Contracts
- **Contacts** = **Offer** + **Acceptance** + **Consideration**
- Legality of Contracts:
  - Agreements that our legal system will enforce and permit.
- Considerations required for legal enforcement for Contracts
  3. Surrogacy example
    - Baby for money?
  4. Committed relationships between two consenting individuals
    - Law School for future expected earnings?
- Promissory Liability is the Foundation of Contract Law
- Contracts enhance trust and create the ability to function in a free market economy
- The Freedom of contract is a foundational for functioning society
- A lawyer's job is to anticipate potential problems and work for client to help protect against harmful outcomes.
- Cases arise from differing interpretation of contracts
- Most Contracts end up in settlement through negotiations or settlement.
- Damages/Punitive Damages:
  - As a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract. Although damages in excess of compensation for loss are in some instances permitted in tort actions by way of punishment, in contract actions the damages recoverable are limited to compensation for pecuniary loss sustained by the breach.

#### Basic Contract Dispute
#### Case: *[White v. Benkowski](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/b6f5c0d1-fc87-40c2-8892-09fd07d1d5d2/?context=1000516)*

<summary>Case Brief</summary>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Tenants were entitled to the actual damages amount determined by the jury, but they were not entitled to punitive damages because punitive damages were not recoverable in breach of contract actions.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Contract drawn up between 2 families on adjacent properties. πs desired to purchase home w/o water supply. Adjacent property owned by ∆s had a well w/ pipes connected to home of π.</li>
        <li>Parites entered into a written agreement.</li>
        <li>10 Years unless municple water became supplied or well became inadequate. Water for money at rate of $3 a month + 1/2 cost of future repairs or maintenance.</li>
        <li>Not in written agreement, π lso $400 dollars given to ∆s to purchase and install new pump and tanks to increase capacity.</li>
        <li>Relationship deteriorated overtime and became hostile.</li>
        <li>∆(B) began shutting off water. 4 time periods recorded.</li>
        <li> First case awarded $2,000 in punitive damages and $10 in compensatory damages. On motion after the verdict, court reduced compensatory award to $1 and granted ∆s motion to strike punitive damage question & answer.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Was the trial court correct in reducing the award of compensatory damages from $10 to $1?</li>
        <li>Are punitive damages available in actions for breach of contract when there is an allegation based on a breach of wanton/malicious act?</li>
      </ol>

    <li><b>Rule:</b>In Wisconsin, compensatory damages are given to make whole the damage or injury suffered by the injured party. On the other hand, punitive damages are given on the basis of punishment to the injured party not because he has been injured, which injury has been compensated with compensatory damages, but to punish the wrongdoer for his malice and to deter others from like conduct.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that the tenants were entitled to $ 10 because that figure was the actual damages determined by the jury and the trial court should not have disturbed that finding The court, however, held that the tenants were not entitled to punitive damages because punitive damages were not recoverable in breach of contract actions. The court held that in some cases where a breach of contractual duty led to a tort violation, punitive damages could be available. However, the court held that because no tort was pled or proven by the tenants, they were not entitled to punitive damages.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Compensatory Damages - Make Whole</li>


  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**:
  - Context for the case: "This case involves a neighborhood squabble between two adjacent property owners."
  - Compensatory Damages
    - Nominal v. Compensatory
  - Punitive Damages
    - “If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;
he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.”
    - Corbin states that as a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract.
      - Allusion to authority.
      - Court fell short of providing **reasons** why punitive damages are not proper.
      - Although it is well recognized that breach of a contractual duty **may be a** tort, in such situations the contract creates the relation out of which grows the duty to use care in the performance of a responsibility prescribed by the contract. Not so here. No tort was pleaded or proved. **Critique of White's Attorney**

## 2.0 Remedies
- How does the law treat someone who has been harmed by a breach of contract?
  - Common Law Remedies can be flexible and attept to help promisee.
  - UCC tries to make promisee whole + incurred costs "for goods"

### 2.1 Common Law Remedies
- **Compensatory** damages, which are given to the party which was detrimented by the breach of contract.
  1. **Expectation**: Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract had been *performed*. "You get what you bargained for"
  2. **Reliance**: Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract had *not been made*.
  3. **Restitution**: Restors to the promisee any benefit he conferred to the promisor.
  4. Expectation damages are the difference between promised performance and actual performance—for instance, between a perfect hand and a hairy, scarred hand. *Hawkins v. McGee*.

- **Nominal** damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.

- **Punitive** or **exemplary** damages are used to punish the party at fault; Contract law does not recognize punitive damages.


### 2.2 Reliance
#### Case: *[Sullivan v. O'Connor](Link)*
- The appropriate measure of damages is the difference between (1) performance of the contract as promised and (2) actual performance.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Where a plastic surgeon promised to improve a patient's appearance and did not, patient could obtain damages for breach of contract, including damages for expenses and for pain and suffering beyond that contemplated.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A surgeon performed plastic surgery upon a patient’s nose two times. Dissatisfied with the results because the surgery disfigured and deformed her nose, she sued for breach of a contract to improve her appearance. The jury found in her favor and awarded damages for expenses and for pain and suffering. The case was elevated to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was there a breach of contract to improve appearance?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Some cases have taken the simple view that the promise by the physician is to be treated like an ordinary commercial promise, and accordingly that the successful plaintiff is entitled to a standard measure of recovery for breach of contract, compensatory damages, an amount intended to put the plaintiff in the position he would be in if the contract had been performed. The plaintiff may elect restitution damages, an amount corresponding to any benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant in the performance of the contract disrupted by the defendant's breach.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the patient could bring a breach of contract action against her doctor because he made promises of a specific outcome, and that pain and suffering beyond that contemplated were compensable. Entitled to recover out of pocket expenses, but also for worsening of the appearance of her nose by the surgery and for pain and suffering and mental distress involved in a third operation. </li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

#### Class Discussion
- Breach of Contract Claim + Negligent Malpractice Tort
  - Jury awarded verdict of $13.5K for Breach of Contract
    - Contract to "Enhance Beauty + Improve Appearence"
  - No Negligent Malpractice
- ∆ claimed restitution should only get cost of surgery (Compensatory)
- ∆ claimed jury instruction for damages in excess
- π would claim Lost Expectancy
  - Formulaic? Not a "Good"
    - Botched Nose v. Enhanced Expected Nose (Subjective)
- Court dodged the bullet by not addressing Lost Expectancy Damages
- Court rules in favor of Reliance Damages (Pre-K)
  - Reliance damages designed to put the π in the monetary position he or she would have been in if the agreement or promise had not been made;
    - Compensation for 3rd operation
    - Compensation for medical expenses associated with 3rd operation
- Hawkins v. McGee (Hairy Hand) = Expected Hand v. Hairy Hand
  - π Entitled to difference in value between two hands
- Medical Science is not an exact science. Court is skeptical of Doctors promises as interpreted by patients
- Policy considerations
  - Too Strict?
    - Raised prices for surgery
    - Defensive medicine
    - Volume of contract disputes
    - Sympathetic juries allocating damages
  - Too Lenient?

### 2.3 Remedies Under The Uniform Commerical Code
##### Article 1 - Remedies to be liberally Administered
  - Compensatory Damages + Search Costs

##### Article 2 of the UCC
- Applies to "Transactions in goods"
  - "Goods" includes "all things" which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale
- Adopted by all states except by Louisiana

## 3.0 Obligation Arising from an Agreement with Consideration

- Consideration is one of the basic requirements of the leading theory of obligation in contractual and related affairs.
  - Consideration = C
  - Consideration is giving something and getting something in return. Both parties get something they want from one another.
- Courts are hesitent to interfere with private transactions (exceptions)
- Consideration has two elements:
  1. Mutual Assent
  2. Exchange of Value
- A Valid Agreement w/ Consideration = (A w/ C)

### 3.1 Freedom of Transaction

#### Case: *[Hardesty v. Smith](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/f0f3a33f-a251-40dd-8ba8-447935669cde/?context=1000516)*

*Freedom of Contract. Freedom to make a good or bad deal*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> π sold rights to an invention, allegedly improving a lamp to ∆. Supposed improvement was worthless</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>Parties of sufficient mental capacity for the management of their own business, have a right to make their own bargains.</li>
    <li>"The doing of an act by one at the request of another, which may be a detriment or inconvenience, however slight, to the party doing it, or may be a benefit, however slight, to the party at whose request it is performed, is a legal consideration for a promise by such requesting party"</li>
      <ul>
        <li>...upon his own judgment, uninfluenced by fraud, or warranty, or mistake of facts...</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Judgement is reversed with costs.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    When a party gets all the consideration he honestly contracted for, he cannot say he gets no consideration, or that it has failed. If the doctrine be not correct, then it is not true that parties are at liberty to make their own contracts.
  </ul>

</details>

- *Class Discussion*
  - Exchange: Invention x Promissory Notes
    - Consideration Issue
      - π claims invention is worthless
      - So trial court rules that consideration is invalid
      - Appellate court reverses on basis of freedom of contract
  - Court will not infringe on freedom of contract
  - Courts examine the EXISTENCE of consideration not the
    - Subjective value is up to the parties
      - Slippery slope argument
  - Consideration does not have to = to expected promise
  - Rule: The doing of an act by one at the request of another, which may be a detriment or inconvenience, however slight, to the party doing it, or may be a benefit, however slight, to the party at whose request it is performed, is a legal consideration for a promise by such requesting party


### 3.2  Donative Promises, Form & Reliance
- Made for affective reasons, usually informal, and not demonstrably relied upon.
  - Executed Promise (Gift) is not the same.

*Donative promises are not enforceable.*

#### Case: *[Dougherty v. Salt](Link)*

- Theories of Obligation
  - Consideration = Bargain for exchange
    - Consideration with writing with a Witness
      - Aunt received no benefit
        - Good feelings/Alturism is not consideration
    - Promissary Exchange
      - Not a present exchange
      - Note indicates "past consideration"
    - Value Received - "Done for me"
      - Cardozo - No Value Received from the boy
- Court will not enforce a "gift promises as contracts"
- **Voidable Legal Capcity for contract**
  - 9 year old contract is **voidable**
    - Infant can claim from party
    - Party cannot claim from infant

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A promissory note that was payable on death, which given to a boy by his aunt who wanted to take care of him, was the voluntary and unenforceable promise of an executory gift, and he was not entitled to payment in his action against the executrix.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The boy's aunt told his guardian, who was a witness for him at trial, that she loved the boy and wanted to take care of him, so she gave him a note payable at her death, which had the words "value received" on it. She died, and in the boy's action against his aunt's executrix for payment of the note, the trial court submitted the question of whether there was consideration for the promised payment to the jury, who returned a verdict in the boy's favor. The trial court set aside the verdict and dismissed the complaint. The appellate court reversed the judgment, and reinstated the verdict, holding that the note was sufficient evidence of consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether a promissory note with the label “value received” issued by the aunt out of her love to her nephew sufficiently establishes consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment, modified the trial court's judgment by granting a new trial, and affirmed the judgment as modified. Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

##### Restatement (First) of Contracts § 75.
- Definition of Consideration.
  1. Consideration for a promise is
    - an act other than a promise, or
    - a forbearance, or
    - the creation, modification or destruction of a legal relation, or
    - a return promise,
 2. AND; bargained for and given in exchange for the promise.
    - Consideration may be given to the promisor or to some other person. It may be given by the promisee or by some other person.


#### 3.2.1 Bare Naked Promise & Consideration
- Acceptance alone is not consideration, but at some point acceptance becomes an act that qualifies as consideration

#### Problem 2-1
1. Consideration could have been given to promisor if promisee was *Induced* by exchange.

#### The Substantive Bases of Contract Liability

- Lon Fuller introduced **substantive** and **process** bases for enforcing promises.
- The two process bases are **evidentiary** *(making sure a promise has actually been made)* and **cautionary** *(preventing inconsiderate action by the promisor)*.
  - **Evidentiary**: Evidentiary security—protecting against manufactured evidence and dealing with insufficient proof.
    - Bargained-for exchange **tends** to produce evidence that a promise was made.
    - Written v. Oral promises as evidence
  - **Cautionary**: Safeguarding the individual against his own rashness.
    - Cautionary process requires promisor to consider legal consequences for promise.
    - Writing out promises requires thought and pause.
  - Simple donative promises are problematic on both bases.
    - People make gift promises all the time
   - They raise problems of proof (evidence may be uncertain) and deliberativeness (the promisor is likely to be emotionally involved with the promisee).
   - Substantive reasons for enforcing donative promises include compensating the promisee’s disappointment (a form of injury), move assets from the wealthy to the less wealthy, and increase the likelihood of beneficial reliance. But these substantive bases are open to question.
  - **Channeling**: Signaling to make sure that the promisor knows the
 promise is enforceable.
    - offers parties a recognizeable method of entering an enforceable obligation.
      - Distinct set of instruction for parties who want to enter into an enforceable exchange.
   - Lease as a contract provides signal to promisee
  - **Deterrent**: Unwillingness to enforce contracts of “suspect or marginal
 value.”



#### Case: *[Maughs v. Porter](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/83b69d1f-aa65-4f2d-a22b-8b881846bcdd/?context=1000516)*

- Plaintiff auction winner appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County (Virginia), which sustained defendant auctioneer's demurrer in the auction winner's action for a money judgment.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An auction winner was unable to recover a money judgment against an auctioneer where the bargain was unenforceable as against public policy because the transaction was consistent with the scheme of a lottery, which was prohibited by state law.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The auction winner won an automobile at an auction organized and advertised by the auctioneer. The auctioneer refused to pay for the automobile when it was delivered and refused to pay the auction winner the value of the car. The circuit court sustained the demurrer filed by the auctioneer in the auction winner's action for a money judgment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the alleged offer to make the gift can be enforced as supported by a sufficient consideration and if it should be determined that there was such a consideration as would otherwise support the gift then:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether the transaction constitutes a lottery which is prohibited by Constitution & Statute</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The intention to give must be accompanied by a delivery, and the delivery must be made with an intention to give. Otherwise there is only an intention or promise to give, which, being gratuitous, would be a mere nullity. Delivery of possession of the thing given or of the means of obtaining it so as to make the disposal of it irrevocable, is indispensable to a valid gift.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>There **was sufficient consideration** to support the gift and but for the other questions involved this would determine the case but the court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court that the bargain was unenforceable and denied the auction winner recovery in the auction winner's action for a money judgment against the auctioneer.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>A gift is a contract without a consideration, and to be valid must be executed. A valid gift is therefore a contract executed.</li>
        <li>Contracts founded upon an illegal consideration, as being contrary to public policy and forbidden by law, are void.</li>
      </ol>
  </ul>

- Advertisement calls for attendance.
  - ∆ benefits by hope of deriving benefit from the crowd so augmented.
  - π claims attendance was induced by advertisement and qualifies as consideration.
  - As in Hardesty, Time in attendence = detriment/inconvenience
- ∆ argument claims it is just a gift with a condition, no consideration and not enforceable.
  - Gift was a condition of a promise. *See Tramp Example*
- ∆ was conducting business in hopes of profit.
  - "Free" not actually "Free"
  - Opposite Daughtery where promise was purely motivated by emotion.

#### Tramp/Homeless Hypo
- **Class Discussion**
  - I’ll call the store and have two suits ready for you. You go to the store and find out I was just kidding. **There’s no consideration.** But what if I make you drive to a store in San Francisco? Is that an act that constitutes consideration? I got what I wanted (for you to go to the store) and you thought you were getting what you wanted (new clothes).
  - Promise of a coat induces a walk around the corner to go to the shop
    - Tramp gives up his legal right to hang on the street to go walk around the block.
      - Court don't question adequecy of consideration
      - Detriment was not requested as the price of the promise, but was merely a condition of a **gratuitous promise.**
        - Walking around the corner is not motivating the promisor to give the coat.
  - Acceptance alone is not consideration, but at some point acceptance becomes an act that qualifies as consideration.


#### Case: *[Carlisle v. T  & R Excavating Inc](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/a92b0db1-cb4c-44da-9bd0-1cab856e2f8f/?context=1000516)*
  - Appellant husband sought review of a decision by the Common Pleas Court, Medina County (Ohio) that entered judgment in favor of appellee wife, in the wife's breach of contract action against the husband.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An agreement providing for reimbursement of materials used to perform free services was not a bargained-for exchange sufficient to form a contract where the promise to provide free services was not made to induce the promise of reimbursement.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In contemplation of divorce, the husband entered into a separation agreement with the wife, although they continued living together for some time afterwards. The agreement provided that in repayment for the wife's services to the husband's business, the husband would provide construction services for the wife's business, and the wife would reimburse the husband for the cost of material. Shortly after the couple separated, the husband discontinued services. The husband contended that there was no contract because the agreement lacked sufficient consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the judgment in favor of the wife. Without consideration there can be no contract. Consideration consists of either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The court found that: 1) the husband's motivation to help the wife's business for furtherance of the relationship or increased marital income was not sufficient consideration; 2) there was no evidence that the husband bargained away the free services to his wife in exchange for the benefit of collecting the cost of materials paid; 3) repayment for services suggested past consideration that was insufficient to form a contract; 4) the promise to reimburse for materials was a condition for a gratuitous promise; and 5) the separation agreement and its contents was invalid because the couple did not immediately separate.</li>

#### Sufficient Consideration
Any bargained-for act or forbearance constitutes consideration. There is no mutuality requirement.

#### Case: *[Hamer v. Sidway](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-hamer-v-sidway.aspx)*

- Plaintiff appealed from an order of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a judgment in his favor in an action to enforce a contract.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Forbearance or abandonment of legal right to use tobacco and alcohol in exchange for the payment of a sum of money was sufficient consideration to enforce the contract.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A testator made an agreement with his nephew that if he refrained from drinking liquor, using tobacco, swearing and playing cards or billiards for money until he reached the age of twenty-one, the testator would pay him $ 5,000. The nephew fulfilled his obligation. When the nephew informed his uncle, it was agreed that the uncle would first keep the money on interest. Unfortunately, the uncle died before any money could be transferred to the nephew. Filing a case for sum of money with the trial court, the judgment was rendered in favor of the nephew but later on reversed by the General Term of the Supreme Court. The case was elevated on appeal to the Court of Appeals of New York.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is a promise to abandon ones legal rights to use tobacco and alcohol considered sufficient consideration to enforce a contract?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Consideration means not so much that one party is profiting as that the other abandons some legal right in the present, or limits his legal freedom of action in the future, as an inducement for the promise of the first.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> It is enough that something is promised done forborne or suffered by the party to whom the promise is made as consideration for the promise made to him.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>It is sufficient that he restricted his lawful freedom of action within certain prescribed limits upon the faith of his uncle's agreement</li>
        <li>The Court held that the right to use and enjoy the use of tobacco is a right that belongs to the nephew and is not forbidden by law. The abandonment of its use is a sufficient consideration to uphold the promise because such abandonment was the inducement for the promise.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Is this a gift with a consideration or bargain for exchange.
  - Detriment to the promisee v. Inducement by the Promisor
  - Detriment is subjective to the person.
    - As long as giving up a legal right or freedom.
  - Promise induced detriment - Motivation of Promisor
    - Uncle's motive was to extract the forbearance from newphew
      - Some discussion that newphew's detriment of legal right was enough.
    - But did the detriment induce the promise?
    - Uncle grandstanding/concerned with reputation of family name




##### Restatement (Second) Of Contracts § 81
  - Consideration as Motive or Inducing Cause
    1. The fact that what is bargained for does not of **itself solely** induce the making of a promise does not prevent it from being consideration for the promise.
    2. The fact that a promise does not of itself induce a performance or return promise does not prevent the performance or return promise from being consideration for the promise.

#### Bargained Theory & Mutual Inducement
- Courts generally do not consider the adequacy of consideration.
  - In a bargained for exchange, promise is said to be supported by consideration because the promisor gets "something in exchange for his/her promise"
    - As long as you are getting **"a something"**
  - Must demonstrate that parties "agreed to exchange"
- The **mutuality rule** required both parties to be obligated to each other, but it did not require **equal consideration.**
  - Broad: “consideration” refers collectively to the things that make contracts legally enforceable—e.g., bargain or reliance.
  - Narrow: “consideration” is the same thing as “bargain.” The Restate- ment Second adopts this approach, known as the bargain theory of consideration.
- The bargain theory of consideration creates two kinds of distortion:
  - **Terminological**: many other elements besides bargain can make a contract enforceable. Therefore, “under the terminology of the Re- statement Second, a promise needs consideration to be enforceable unless it does not need consideration to be enforceable.”
  - **Substantive**: the bargain theory presumes that all nonbargain promises are unenforceable. It does not allow the law to develop other means of making promises enforceable.


#### Case: *[Baehr v. Penn-O-Tex Oil Corp.](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/f54592e4-be10-4e64-8360-d1a530505f01/?context=1000516)*
- Plaintiff lessor appealed an order from the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) granting defendant oil company's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in the lessor's action to recover rents allegedly owed because of possession and contract.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The lessor leased gas stations to a lessee doing business as the oil company he was buying. The lessee could not meet payments due to the oil company and assigned accounts receivable, including those involving the lessor's gas stations. The oil company installed its agent in the lessee's office and collected rents paid by the filing station operators. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was there a legally enforceable contract between the parties?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed the district court's order granting the oil company's motion for a JNOV. The oil company's installation of the agent in the lessee's office to collect money due the lessee and assigned to the oil company did not make it liable to pay the lessee's rent. The agent's promise to the lessor to pay rent was unenforceable because there was no consideration, and the promise did not amount to a contract.</li>

- Plaintiffs brought a diversity action against defendants for breach of an oral contract, breach of implied warranty, violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, and promissory estoppel, arising from a promise to replace defective windows.

- Plaintiffs sought review of the decision of a trial court (New York), which dismissed plaintiffs' action against defendants to prevent defendants from collecting a portion of the proceeds from the sale of a parcel of land inherited by plaintiffs.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendant was entitled to share in the proceeds from the sale of a parcel of land inherited by defendant and plaintiff because plaintiffs' alleged promise to forego any interest in the land lacked consideration and was not enforceable.</li>

    <li><b>Rule:</b> A valuable consideration may consist of some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court concluded that plaintiffs had no colorable right to the property received by defendants so there was no consideration or contract.

#### Mutuality of Obligation
#### Case: *[De Los Santos v. Great Western Sugar Company](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/26dd8315-cbcd-46a8-9826-29cad4ff229d/?context=1000516)*
- Plaintiff trucker appealed from a decision of the District Court for Scotts Bluff County (Nebraska), which granted summary judgment for defendant sugar company in the trucker's action for breach of contract.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A sugar company was not liable for breach of contract when it terminated a trucker's services for hauling beets after two months because the contract did not specify a quantity of beets and allowed the company to terminate at any time.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The trucker, an independent contractor, entered a contract with the sugar company that called for the trucker to haul only such tonnage of beets as might be loaded by the sugar company upon the trucker's trucks. The sugar company terminated the trucker after two months of hauling. The trucker contended that he was entitled to haul until all of the beets had been transported to the factory.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Mutuality is absent when one only of the contracting parties is bound to perform</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The contract was unenforceable because neither the trucker nor the sugar company intended to or did, either in fact or law, promise to transport a specific quantity of beets or promise to transport beets during a specific period of time. The term of the contract did not constitute a promise, but merely established the period of time during which the promises that were contained in the contract would be in effect. The sugar company's right to control the amount of beets loaded onto the trucker's trucks was a right to terminate the contract at any time, and rendered the contract as to its unexecuted portions void for want of mutuality.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>

#### Satisfaction Clauses
- Promise with condition that promisor is "**satisfied**"
- Good faith obligation means that your decision about whether you are satisfied must be reasonable or honest.
- Satisfaction clauses constitute consideration when courts read them as requiring good faith. Otherwise, the satisfaction clause would not involve a commitment, so the promise would be illusory.
- If satisfaction clause deals with "commercial value or quality, operative fitness or mechanical utility" courts generally apply reasonableness test.
  - Satisfaction as compared with other market alternatives.
- If satisfaction deals with "fancy, taste, or judgement" courts apply the honesty test.

#### Implied Obligation & Good Faith
- The intent of the parties outweighs “primitive formalism.”
#### Case: *[Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-wood-v-lucy-lady-duff-gordon.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A marketer was entitled to performance of an implied contract with a fashion designer where mutuality of obligation existed, although imperfectly expressed, with express promises of sales and profit sharing.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant is a "creator of fashions" whose favor helps a sale, and manufacturers of feminine apparel are willing to pay for a certificate of her approval. She entered into an agreement with plaintiff employing him to turn this vogue into money. He was to have, for the term of one year, and thereafter unless terminated by a written notice, the exclusive right, subject to her approval, to place her indorsements on the designs of others and in return she was to have one-half of all profits and revenues derived from any contract he might make. Plaintiff claims that he kept the contract and that the defendant broke it, by placing her indorsement on articles without his knowledge and withholding the profits, and sues her for the damages. Defendant demurs to the complaint on the ground that the agreement lacks the elements of a contract in that plaintiff does not bind himself to anything. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is there mutuality in the contract?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A promise may be lacking within a contract, and yet the whole writing may be instinct with an obligation, imperfectly expressed. If that is so, there is a contract. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that upon examination of the contract, although plaintiff does not promise in express terms, such a promise is fairly implied. Defendant gave an exclusive privilege and plaintiff's promise to pay one-half of the profits and revenues resulting from the exclusive agency and to render accounts monthly, was a promise to use reasonable efforts to bring profits and revenues into existence, and, hence, the demurrer cannot be sustained.</li>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Cardozo "The law has outgrown is primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was the sovereign talisman and every slip was fatal.”136 The clear intent of the parties was to give the plaintiff an exclusive right. The defendant cannot escape that right on a formal technicality."

#### Uniform Commerical Code §1-304 - Obligation of Good Faith
- Every contract or duty within the UCC imposes an *obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement*.


#### Uniform Commerical Code §2-306(2)
- A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use *best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale*
- Terms dealing with expected output, requirements, and exclusive dealings must be followed in good faith.
  - Requirements contract: a seller agrees to provide as much of a good as the buyer requires
  - Output contract: a buyer agrees to buy all of a seller’s output.
- Traditionally, “courts often refused to enforce requirements contracts where the buyer could choose to have no requirements.” But both parties shrunk their realm of choice, so there was mutual consideration.
  - “ . . . a modern court would almost certainly hold that all requirements and output contracts have consideration.”


#### Mutuality of Obligation
- As long as there is sufficient consideration, unequal terms do not invalidate a contract

#### Case: *[Weiner v. McGraw-Hill, Inc.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A former employee stated a cause of action in contract where he alleged that his former employer discharged him without sufficient cause or rehabilitation attempts, in violation of an employment agreement.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π entered upon a career in book publishing with another employer & was invited to engage in discussions looking towards his joining the staff of ∆. ∆ representative assured π of company's firm policy not to terminate employees without "just cause". Employment with ∆ would bring him job security. π signed McGraw form where specified that π would be subject to the provisions of handbook on personnel policies and procedures. π forfeited fringe benefits and salary increase that were to induce him to remain at current employ so as to take job with ∆ company. π worked for 8 years at ∆ company and was raised in his level of compensation and rank. He suddenly found himself discharged for "lack of application" π seeks damages for wrongful termination.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the π though not engaged for a fixed term of employment, pleaded a good cause of action for breach of contract against his employer.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Mutuality in the sense of requiring such reciprocity is not necessary when a promisor receives other valid considerations. Court found sufficient evidence of a contact and a breach to sustain a cause of action. π was induced to leave previous employment with assurance that ∆ would not discharge him without cause. Second, assurance was incorporated into the employment application. Third π rejected other offers of employment in reliance on the assurance. Fourth appellant alleged that when he had recommendend certain subordinates be dismissed he was instructed to proceed in strict compliance with handbook and policy because employees could be discharged only for just cause. If he did not comply with handbook, ∆ would be liable for legal action. Therefore factors combine to present a question, was ∆ bound to a promise not to discharge π without just and sufficient cause and an opportunity for rehabilitation. Order reversed.</li>

- **Class Discussion**

- **Case Examples**
  - *Kamboj v. Eli Lilly & Co*
    - Absent special circumstances, mere relinquishment of a prior job to take a new job is insufficient consideration. **But** *if the employee's forbearance is a "specifically bargained for detriment" it can be said that the employee has surrendered something of value in exchange for the promise of employment and therefore that adequate consideration exists.*



#### Case: *[Mattei v. Hopper](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> π brought action for damages after ∆ breached a contract by failing to convey her real property in accordance with terms of a deposit receipt which the parties had executed.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π real estate developer was planning to construct a shopping center on a tract of ∆ land. After many attempts ∆ accepted π offer to buy land. π was given 120 days to examine the title and consummate the purchase after deposting $1000. Concluding clause provided that purchase contingent on Coldwell Banker & Co. obtaining leases satisfactory to the purchaser. 120 days and clause as means for arranging satisfactory leases of the shopping center building prior to the time he was finally committed to pay the balance of the purchase price and to take title to ∆ property. While π was in process of securing leases, ∆ attorney notified π that ∆ would not sell her land under terms contained in the deposit receipt. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the deposit receipt no more than an offer by her which could only be accepted by π notifying her that all of the desired leases had been obtained and were satifactory to him.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To make a contract where promises are exchanged as consideration, the promises must be mutual in obligation. Both much have assumed some legal obligations.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> ∆ thesis that deposit is no more than an offer must be rejected. The whole purhcase receipt and particular cluase must be read as merely making πs performance dependent on the obtaining of "satisfactory" leases. A contract arose, and π was given the power and privilege to terminate it in the event he did not obtain such leases. Accords with general view that deposit receipts are binding and enoforceable contracts. </li>

- Corbin on Contracts: A promise conditional upon the promisor's satisfaction is not illusory since it means more than the validity of the performance is to depend on the arbitary choice of the promisor.


#### The Preexisting Duty Doctrine
- Performance of an existing duty is not consideration.
  - Neither the performance of duty nor the promise to render a performance already required by duty is a sufficient consideration for a return promise.
- Contract Modification
  - Accord & Satisfaction
- Withholding performance does not create consideration for a modification. It looks more like extortion.


- *Case Examples*
  - Haigh v. Brooks
    - Giving up a piece of paper, however objectively worthless it may have been would be consideration.
- **Corbin on Contracts**
  - Parting with a document, contents which render no service, has been held to be a consideration for a promise to pay a large sum of money.
- Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 79
  - Adequacy of Consideration
    - If the requirement of consideration is met, there is no additional requirement of equivalence in the values exchanged.

#### Substantive Bases of Contract Liability

-Common law recognizes several general theories of obligation.
-Recognized basis for imposing legal duties.
-Predominant theory is that legal duties arise from a valid agreement with consideration (a contract)
  - Agreement = Two or more persons have expressed themselves in harmony
  - Consideration = as a bargained for exchange
- Other Forms of agreements
  - Standard form agreements
    - Majority of contracts made
      - Routine Transactions to Leases, deeds, mortages
    - Provide information and enforce order
    - One of the beliefs by which our society is organized, is that at least some lawmaking is better accomplished in a decentralized manner.
  - Oral Agreements
  - Informal Agreements
-Relational Exchange
  - Discrete = Little interaction between the parties
  - Relational = Occuring through time in a process of continuous interaction between parties.
    - The more relational an exchange the more it is projected into the future, the more likely the parties and their lawyers will be unable to adance to define performance obligations with precision or to allocate risks optimally.
      - May relay on norms to govern their relation other than those arising from the original agreement.
- Social Resources that Facilitate agreements and their Performance
  - Specialization o labor, results in a need for exchange behavior. As individuals specializ, they become lesss self-sufficient and more dependent on other's goods and services which they must secure through agreements.

  - Exchange by Tradition (Manor)
  - Exchange by Authority (Army)
