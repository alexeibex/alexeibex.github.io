#### **1.1 Contracts & Related Obligations**

###### 1.1.1 Damages/Punitive Damages: *As a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract.

<summary>Case: <i>White v. Benkowski</i></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Tenants were entitled to the actual damages amount determined by the jury, but they were not entitled to punitive damages because punitive damages were not recoverable in breach of contract actions.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Contract drawn up between 2 families on adjacent properties. πs desired to purchase home w/o water supply. Adjacent property owned by ∆s had a well w/ pipes connected to home of π.</li>
        <li>Parites entered into a written agreement.</li>
        <li>10 Years unless municple water became supplied or well became inadequate. Water for money at rate of $3 a month + 1/2 cost of future repairs or maintenance.</li>
        <li>Not in written agreement, π lso $400 dollars given to ∆s to purchase and install new pump and tanks to increase capacity.</li>
        <li>Relationship deteriorated overtime and became hostile.</li>
        <li>∆(B) began shutting off water. 4 time periods recorded.</li>
        <li> First case awarded $2,000 in punitive damages and $10 in compensatory damages. On motion after the verdict, court reduced compensatory award to $1 and granted ∆s motion to strike punitive damage question & answer.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Was the trial court correct in reducing the award of compensatory damages from $10 to $1?</li>
        <li>Are punitive damages available in actions for breach of contract?</li>
      </ol>

    <li><b>Rule:</b>In Wisconsin, compensatory damages are given to make whole the damage or injury suffered by the injured party. On the other hand, punitive damages are given on the basis of punishment to the injured party not because he has been injured, which injury has been compensated with compensatory damages, but to punish the wrongdoer for his malice and to deter others from like conduct.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that the tenants were entitled to $ 10 because that figure was the actual damages determined by the jury and the trial court should not have disturbed that finding The court, however, held that the tenants were not entitled to punitive damages because punitive damages were not recoverable in breach of contract actions. The court held that in some cases where a breach of contractual duty led to a tort violation, punitive damages could be available. However, the court held that because no tort was pled or proven by the tenants, they were not entitled to punitive damages.</li>

**Summary:**
**Facts:**

**Rule:**

**Conclusion:**
Jury instructions for damages was incorrect. No compensatory damages. Original $10 compensatory damages were excessive for the cost of water.Damages were nominal and the evidence shows that the amount was for much less than what was awarded. Punitive damages could not be awarded unless jury could show wanton or malicious intent/vindictive. Symbolic remedy awarded and so nominal damages awarded (In name only).
**Notes/Concepts:**
Case could have been prevented if clarification of "inadequate" was given more definition. Initial contract was weak.
