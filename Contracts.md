<summary>Case: *Whites v. Benkowskis*</summary>

**Summary:**  
**Facts:**  
Contract drawn up between 2 families. Water for money.
Alleged overuse of water by π(Benkowskis) resulted in ∆(Whites) with shutting off water. Relationship broke down. First case awarded $2,000 in punitive damages and $10 in compensatory damages. Motion after the verdict for new trial because of wrong jury instruction for punitive damages.  
**Rule:**  

**Conclusion:**  
Jury instructions for damages was incorrect. No compensatory damages. Original $10 compensatory damages were excessive for the cost of water.Damages were nominal and the evidence shows that the amount was for much less than what was awarded. Punitive damages could not be awarded unless jury could show wanton or malicious intent/vindictive. Symbolic remedy awarded and so nominal damages awarded (In name only).   
**Notes/Concepts:**
Case could have been prevented if clarification of "inadequate" was given more definition. Initial contract was weak.
