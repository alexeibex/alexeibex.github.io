## Introduction to Contracts
### Basic Contracts
- Deal with the Devil
  - Basic contract law principles. One party wants something right away the other must wait.
  - Take the future effectively make it the present by contract
- [Nick Szabo on Contracts](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)
  - The contract, a set of promises agreed to in a "meeting of the minds", is the traditional way to formalize a relationship.
  - Whether enforced by a government, or otherwise, the contract is the basic building block of a free market economy. Over many centuries of cultural evolution has emerged both the concept of contract and principles related to it, encoded into common law.

#### Freedom of Contract
- Foundational Principle of Contract Law that underpins all Judicial decisions in some way
- Promissory Liability is the Foundation of Contract Law
- Contracts enhance trust and create the ability to function in a free market economy
- The Freedom of contract is a foundational for functioning society
- A lawyer's job is to anticipate potential problems and work for client to help protect against harmful outcomes.
- Cases arise from differing interpretation of contracts
- Most Contracts end up in settlement through negotiations or settlement.
- Damages/Punitive Damages:
  - As a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract. Although damages in excess of compensation for loss are in some instances permitted in tort actions by way of punishment, in contract actions the damages recoverable are limited to compensation for pecuniary loss sustained by the breach.
    - See *[White v. Benkowski](link)
      - Context for the case: "This case involves a neighborhood squabble between two adjacent property owners."
      - Compensatory Damages
        - Nominal v. Compensatory
      - Punitive Damages
        - “If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.”
        - Corbin states that as a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract.
          - Allusion to authority.
          - Court fell short of providing **reasons** why punitive damages are not proper.
          - Although it is well recognized that breach of a contractual duty **may be a** tort, in such situations the contract creates the relation out of which grows the duty to use care in the performance of a responsibility prescribed by the contract. Not so here. No tort was pleaded or proved. **Critique of White's Attorney**
