1. Party to recover = The Injured Party

## Overview for Remedies
1. Expectancy Damages
  1. Seeks to give the injured party the money equivalent of what they expected from the contract so that they are in as good a position as if the contract had not been breached.
    1. Restatement §344
1. Reliance Damages
  1. Seeks to put the party in a position they were in prior to the formation of the K.
    1. Restatement §344 - Reliance Interest = Reimbursment for the loss caused by the reliance on the K.
  1. Differs from expectancy in that injured party does not recover the value of the broken promise.
1. Liquidated Damages
  1. Measure of Damages contractually agreed to by parties in case of breach
    1. Reasonably estimation of actual damages to be recover by injured party if K is broken.

### Remedies for Breach of Contract
#### 1. Expectancy Damages
  1. Goal = To Compensate the Injured Party NOT to punish the breaching party
    1. Example
      1. Party creates K to sell Piano to A for $1200 Dollars
      2. Market value = $1400
      3. Party breaks K
      4. Alice Expectancy Damages = $200
        1. Expecting Piano for $1200 now can recoup $200 to buy Market Value piano for $1400
  1. Market Price Damages = **General Damages**
    1. Measure the market value of the very thing promised, at the time of performance, as a basis for calculation
  1. Special Damages (Search Costs) = **Consequential Damages**
    1. Measure of reasonably foreseeable damages, known and communicated at the time of contract formation.
    1. “A measure larger than expectancy would discourage them from making contracts because they would be wary of the extent of their liability for breach.”
  1. Why Have Expectancy Damages?
    1. Reliance on contract creation which benefits society.
    1. Parties can rely on their K assured that they will recieve either the equivilant in compensation for performance or the equiviant in compensation for nonperformance.
  1. **Theory of Efficient Breach**
    1. Expectancy damages encourage a party to breach when the breach is efficient
#### 2. Methods of Measuring Expectancy Damages
  1. Fundamental Question: Objective v. Subjective
    1. Objective = Based on the market value of the promised performance to some "hypothetical reasonble person"
    2. Subjective = Based on the value of performance "to the injured party himself" in light of the party's particular circumstances.
    1. Division among Courts
      1. Some courts will award damages based on the injured parties subjective perspective
      2. Other Courts will award based on objective measure
