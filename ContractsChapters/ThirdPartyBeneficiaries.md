#### Intended and Incidental Beneficiaries


##### Creditor Beneficiaries
- “The **consideration** received and the promise to Holly made it as plainly his duty to pay Lawrence as if the money had been remitted to Fox for that purpose, and as well implied a promise to do so as if he had been made a trustee of property to be converted into cash with which to pay.”
  - Implied Consideration based on Consideration as an evidentiary function and dissausive function.
  - Lack of privity between 3rd party
- Vesting/Discharge Issue
- Dissent: Comstock
  - π had nothing to do with promise which brought action
  - K requires privity & considertion

  - See *[Lawrence v. Fox](link)

##### Donee Beneficiaries
- “Insofar as intent to benefit a third person is important in determining his right to bring an action under a contract, it is sufficient that the promisor must have understood that the promisee had such intent”
- “The challenge, of course, is determining in a given case what a reasonable promisor should understand about the promisee’s purpose in making a contract”
  - Interpreting if the promisor conferred a benefit for the promisee to sue if benefit is not received
  - If K has intention by parties to conferr benefit to sue than court should uphold the promise and enforce the K.
    - See *[Seaver v. Ransom](link)*



##### Incidental Beneficiary
- The contract did not evidence “an intention that the promisor is to be answerable to individual members of the public as well as to the city..."
  - “The field of obligation would be expanded beyond reasonable limits” if the citizen could sue under these circumstances”
