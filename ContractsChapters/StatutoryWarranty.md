  - Express Warranties by Affirmation, Promise Description, Sample
  1. Express Warranties by the seller are created as follows:
    1. Any **affirmation of fact or promise** made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis ofthe bargain becomes an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promises.
    1. Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the **bargain** creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
    2. Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model
  1. It is not necessary to the creation ofthe warranty that the seller use formal words such as "warrant" or "guarantee" or that he even *intends to make a warranty*; BUT a mere affirmation of the value of the goods or a statement "purporting to be the seller's opinion" does not create a warranty.

- Notes:
  - **Affirmation of fact or promise**
    - Balance against "merely a seller's opinion or commendation on goods"
