## Additional Theories for Enforcing Promises
- 3 Additional Theories for Promise Enforcement
  - Promssory Estoppel
  - Unjust Enrichment
  - Warranties
- Theories allow for contract enforcement when there is no [Bargain for Exchange](link)


### Promissory Estoppel
- Traditional Gift Promises are not enforceable, BUT Promissory Estoppel examines gift promises that induce a promisee to rely on the promise.
  - Finding a promise as a mere gratuity when brother invited his sister to stay on his land and she accepted and moved. But dicta suggests law **should** enforce the promise because the sister was induced by the promise.
  - See [Kirskey v. Kirskey](link)
- General Trend toward enforceent of promises resulted in Restatement
  - "A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of on the part of the promisee and which does not induce such action or forbearance is binding if justice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires"

#### The Promise
- "A Promise is an assurance, in whatever form or expression given, that the thing will or will not be done"
  - Where an oil company's agent expressed intention to pay the rent did not constitute a promsie.
    - See *[Baehr v. Penn-O-Tex Oil](link)*
- Condition precedent of promises is enforceable
  - Profitability of Youngstown Steel was never fulfilled and detrimental reliance cannot be found because the promise was conditional and contingent as opposed to clear and definite.
    - See *[Local 1330, United Steel Workers v. United States Steel Corp.](link)*
#### Promisor's Reasonable Expectations
- Promisor must reasonably expect the promise to induce action or forbearance
  - Often interpratation regarding the reasonablness of the promisee's reliance on the promise

#### Inducement of Action or Forbearance
- Promise must actually induce action or forbearance and must act
  - Examination of Detriment to the Promisee
    - If there is no **actual** detriment no forbearance
- The Evil to be rectified through promissory estoppel is not the breach of the promise but the harm that resulted from the promisor's inducement and the promisee's reliance
  - See *[Neiss v. Ehlers](link)*

#### Injustice
- Promise is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise
  - Courts given a lot of discretion on the standard of **injustice**
    - Injustice should include an examination of relevant policies
- Issues arise with "At Will" Employment
  - At will employment constitutes a job without a guaranteed duration, and employer can terminate at any time.

### Expansion of Promissory Estoppel
- Expansion of Promissory Estoppel to cases where a bargain was unenforcable because some of some defense available to the promisor.
  - Enforcing a promise basedon on promissory estoppel to procure or make a loan so that Wheeler could develope his property, after Wheeler tore down the existing building and prepared for new construction. Contract was invalid because parties failed to agree on key terms, including interest rate of loan but Court upheld promise based on promissory estoppel
    - See *[Wheeler v. White](link)*
  - Enforcing a Promise through promissory estoppel to appear in a broadway show even though both parties had failed to sign a final agreement because she demonstrated enthusiasm, and Franklin should have known producer would have expended effort to promote based on her acceptance.
    - See *[Elvin Assocs. v. Franklin](link)*
    - Holding that Red Owl's promissory representations induced the Hoffman's to act and rely to their detriment, thereby establishing Promissory Estoppel as a powerful doctrine where a party can be liable for representations made prior to the culmination of a contract.
      - See *[Hoffman v. Red-Owl Stores](link)*
- Ramficications of Promissory Estoppel Expansion
  - Radical and Expansive area of promissory liability and could potentially swollow up bargain theory of contract to become the dominant theory for enforcing promises
  - In reality it is not that successful in court as claim is often tacked on
  - Promissory Estoppel is usually not available when an enforcable contract governs the relationship.

### Unjust Enrichment
- Alternatives: *Quantum Meruit/Restitution/Quasi-Contract/Contract Implied in Law*
- Summary: When a party confers a beneift on another party and it would be unjust for the recepient to retain the benefit without paying for it, the law imposes an obligation on the recepient to pay or return the benefit.
  - Moral Principle that one who has received a benefit has a duty to make restitution when to retain such a benfit would be unjust.
  - Not based on an agreement between the parties but instead based on requiring one party to disgorge itself of the benefit received from another party.
  - See *[Bloomgarden v. Coyer](link)*

## Obligation: Moral Obligation

## Moral Obligation Theory
- Moral obligations do not make promises enforceable.
- **Past consideration** is required.
  - Traditionally, there are **three areas** in which a promise to discharge a prior unenforceable obligation is binding:
    - A promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations.
    - A promise by an adult to a pay a debt incurred when the person is underage.
    - A promise to pay a debt that has been discharged by bankruptcy.
  - Equity can compel courts to depart from the rule [*Webb v. McGown*](https://alexeibex.github.io/Contracts#case-webb-v-mcgowin)
  - Past Consideration is sometimes binding. Some cases are “gratuitous transactions” (with no consideration) and “quasi-contracts” (with consideration, if justice requires).

#### Case Law:
- *Mills v. Wyman*
- *Webb v. McGowin*
- *Edson v. Poppe*

### Restatement of Contracts §86
#### Promise for Benefit Receieved
1. A promise made in recognition of a benefit previously recieved by the promisor from the promisee is binding to the extent necessary to prevent injustice
2. A promise is not binding under Subsection (1):
  1. IF the promisee conferred the benefit as a gift or for other reasons the promisor has not been unjustly enriched;
  2. To the extent that its value is disproportionate to the benefit.

### Example
- If A confers a benefit on B without B’s prior request, the subsequent relationship could fall into three categories:
  - B is legally obligated to compensate A under the law of unjust enrichment—for instance, if A paid B money by mistake. The Restatement (Second) adopts this approach, though courts traditionally did not recognize it.
  - B is morally but not legally obligated to compensate A—for instance, if B has suffered a loss on rescuing A. *Mills v. Wyman.*
  - B is neither morally nor legally obligated to compensate A— e.g., ordinary gifts.
