## Policing Agreements and Promises
- Tensions weighed against *Freedom of Contract*
- Doctrines of Policing Contracts arise under determining Judicial Enforcement of Contract
  - Under what circumstances will courts invalidate contracts that have "legitimately" formed under "basic" Contract formation
### Policing Doctrines
#### Minors
  - The general rule is thatthe contract of a minor, other than for necessaries, is either void or voidable at his option.”
  - Minors cannot disaffirm contracts for “necessaries” because contract law does not want to discourage people from contracting with minors for goods and services constituting essential needs of the minor.
    - Necessities Include:
      - Food
      - Clothing
      - Shelter
      - Appropriate to the Minor's situation


#### Duress
  - Definition: There must be some threatend exercise of power or authority over a [person's] person or property which can be avoided only by making the payment.
    - π must show that the other party by wrongful acts or threats, intentionally caused the π to involuntarily enter into a particular transaction.
      - See *[Standard Box Co. v. Mutual Biscuit Co.](Link)*
      - "Driving a hard Bargain - Future expectancy is not a legal right on which the plaintiff can anchor a claim of economic duress. There appears to be general acknowledgement that duress is not shown because one party to the contract has driven a hard bargain or that market or other conditions now make the contract more difficult to perform by one of the parties or that financial circumstances may have caused one party to make concessions.
        - See *[Machinery Hauling, Inc. v. Steel of West Viginia](link)*
    - Modern Rule: **Has the person complaining been constrained to do what he otherwise would not have done**?
      - Courts should ignore how the party claiming duress got itself in its precarious position.
      - One person cannot claim to have been placed under duress if they pay money to the defendants for the relief of another person.
        - See *[S.P. Dunham & Co. v. Kudra](link)*
    - Price Gouging
      - Most states have enacted price gouging statutes. Generally, these apply only if the state has declared a state of emergency and a vendor charges an **unconscionable** or **excessive** and **unjustified** price.

#### Undue Influence

  - In re Baby Boy L., 144 A.D.2d 674, 534 N.Y.S.2d 706 (App. Div. 1988)
  - Lower Court = Duress
    - With reference for the facts at bar nicole's mother was a primary impetus

#### Misrepresentation, Concealment, and the Duty to Disclose
  - Innocent Misrepresentation - Untrue
    - A person seasonably **may rescind** a contract to which they have been induced to become a party in **reliance upon** false though innocent misrepresentations respecting a cognizable **material fact** made of their own knowledge by the other party to the contract.
      - See *[Bates v. Cashman]

#### Misrepresentation and Reasonable Reliance
  - A buyer cannot generally be held to be able to judge the contents of a parcel of land by the eye. Even though a buyer examines land before purchasing, they may normally rely upon the representations of the seller as to measurement.
  - The Benefit-of-the-Bargain Rule: A defrauded purchaser is entitled to the difference between the value the property would have had as represented and the value of the property they actually received.
  - A recovery of exemplary or punitive damages in an action based on fraudulent sale will be allowed ONLY WHERE the fraud is an aggravated one, as where it is malicious, deliberate, gross, or wanton.
    - See *[Holcomb v. Hoffschneider](link)*

#### Limits of Reasonable Reliance
  - Failure to do simple investigation at the time of receiving the ring does not protect against misrepresentation
     - See *[Porreco v. Porreco](link)*

#### Fraudulent Concealment
  - Silence may be fraudulent and relief may be granted to one contractual party where the other suppresses facts which they, under the circumstances, are bound in conscience and duty to disclose to the other party, and in respect to which they cannot, innocently, be silent.
  - If either party to a contract of sale conceals or suppresses a material fact which they are in good faith bound to disclose, then the silence is fraudulent.
  - **Minor conditions** which ordinary sellers and purchasers would reasonably disregard as of little or no materiality in the transaction would clearly not call for judicial intervention.
    - See *[Weintraub v. Krobatsch](link)*
