## Policing Agreements and Promises
- Tensions weighed against *Freedom of Contract*
- Doctrines of Policing Contracts arise under determining Judicial Enforcement of Contract
  - Under what circumstances will courts invalidate contracts that have "legitimately" formed under "basic" Contract formation
### Policing Doctrines
#### Minors
  - The general rule is that the contract of a minor, other than for necessaries, is either void or voidable at his option.”
  - Minors cannot disaffirm contracts for “necessaries” because contract law does not want to discourage people from contracting with minors for goods and services constituting essential needs of the minor.
    - Necessities Include:
      - Food
      - Clothing
      - Shelter
      - Appropriate to the Minor's situation


#### Duress
  - Definition: There must be some threatend exercise of power or authority over a [person's] person or property which can be avoided only by making the payment.
    - π must show that the other party by wrongful acts or threats, intentionally caused the π to involuntarily enter into a particular transaction.
      - See *[Standard Box Co. v. Mutual Biscuit Co.](Link)*
      - "Driving a hard Bargain - Future expectancy is not a legal right on which the plaintiff can anchor a claim of economic duress. There appears to be general acknowledgement that duress is not shown because one party to the contract has driven a hard bargain or that market or other conditions now make the contract more difficult to perform by one of the parties or that financial circumstances may have caused one party to make concessions.
        - See *[Machinery Hauling, Inc. v. Steel of West Viginia](link)*
    - Modern Rule: **Has the person complaining been constrained to do what he otherwise would not have done**?
      - Courts should ignore how the party claiming duress got itself in its precarious position.
      - One person cannot claim to have been placed under duress if they pay money to the defendants for the relief of another person.
        - See *[S.P. Dunham & Co. v. Kudra](link)*
    - Price Gouging
      - Most states have enacted price gouging statutes. Generally, these apply only if the state has declared a state of emergency and a vendor charges an **unconscionable** or **excessive** and **unjustified** price.

#### Undue Influence
  - See [Nicole Hypo](link)
  - In re Baby Boy L., 144 A.D.2d 674, 534 N.Y.S.2d 706 (App. Div. 1988)
  - Lower Court = Duress
    - With reference for the facts at bar nicole's mother was a primary impetus

#### Misrepresentation, Concealment, and the Duty to Disclose
  - Innocent Misrepresentation - Untrue
    - A person seasonably **may rescind** a contract to which they have been induced to become a party in **reliance upon** false though innocent misrepresentations respecting a cognizable **material fact** made of their own knowledge by the other party to the contract.
      - See *[Bates v. Cashman]

#### Misrepresentation and Reasonable Reliance
  - A buyer cannot generally be held to be able to judge the contents of a parcel of land by the eye. Even though a buyer examines land before purchasing, they may normally rely upon the representations of the seller as to measurement.
  - The Benefit-of-the-Bargain Rule: A defrauded purchaser is entitled to the difference between the value the property would have had as represented and the value of the property they actually received.
  - A recovery of exemplary or punitive damages in an action based on fraudulent sale will be allowed ONLY WHERE the fraud is an aggravated one, as where it is malicious, deliberate, gross, or wanton.
    - See *[Holcomb v. Hoffschneider](link)*

#### Limits of Reasonable Reliance
  - Failure to do simple investigation at the time of receiving the ring does not protect against misrepresentation
     - See *[Porreco v. Porreco](link)*

#### Fraudulent Concealment
  - Silence may be fraudulent and relief may be granted to one contractual party where the other suppresses facts which they, under the circumstances, are bound in conscience and duty to disclose to the other party, and in respect to which they cannot, innocently, be silent.
  - If either party to a contract of sale conceals or suppresses a **material** fact which they are in good faith bound to disclose, then the silence is fraudulent.
    - Material = Any Conditions that would make buyer reconsider his purchase and potentially not follow through with the purchase.
  - **Minor conditions** which ordinary sellers and purchasers would reasonably disregard as of little or no materiality in the transaction would clearly not call for judicial intervention.
  - Moral baseline as Cases continued to weigh against Freedom to Contract
    - A duty to speak whenever **justice equity and fair dealing demand it.**
      - Standard leaves a lot of interpretation
      - Criteria of Interptration looks at Market Pricing, Public Information
    - See *[Weintraub v. Krobatsch](link)*
- General Rule: Buyer has no duty to disclose to seller any findings they happen upon.
  - Unless Fraudulent activity is involved
- Exculpatory Clauses
  - Party seeking to enforce a contract with an exculpatory clause has the burden of showing that the provisions were explained to the other party and came to his knowledge and there was in fact a real and voluntary meeting of the minds and not merely an objective meaning.
  - Duty to Explain Agreement or else unbalanced/unfair
    - Prodigious amount of bargaining power on behalf of the stronger party
    - Failure to read the lease upon signing v. Duty to Disclose Unclear Provisions
      - Even with Objective manifestation of Assent Court will invalidate it considering the circumstances
    - Unenforceable as a matter of **Public Policy**
      - See *[Weaver v. American Oil](link)*

#### Public Policy
- Illegal & General Policy the makes Contracts Unenfoceable/Void
- Exculpatory Clauses v. Public Policy
  - Contract Defense to a Torts Claim
    - One who leases a portion of their premises but retains control over the approaches, common passageways, stairways, and other areas to be used in common by the owner and tenants, has a duty to use reasonable care to keep them in safe condition for use of the tenant in their enjoyment of the demised premises.
      - When applied to a specific situation, one may be exempt from liability from his own negligence only when the consequences thereof do not fall greatly below the standard established by law.
      - Decision based on macro public policy and not the indvidiual right to freedom of contract
      - See *[McCutcheon v. United States](link)*
  - Exculpatory agreements in the recreational sports context do not implicate the public interest.
  - Parties may contract that one shall not be liable for their negligence to another but that such other shall assume the risk incident to such negligence
  - An exculpatory provision which specifically and expressly releases a defendant from its own negligence will be upheld, without regard to whether the injury sustained is one typically thought to be inherent in the sport. However, there is a split of authority among the states regarding whether the word ‘negligence’ is even required to be present in the exculpation clause for the provision to be construed as releasing the defendant from its own negligence.

  - 6 Criteria Set Forth for Public Policy
    - See *[Henderson v. Quest Expeditions](link)*

- Non-Compete Clauses
  - Since there are powerful considerations of public policy which militate against sanctioning the loss of a person’s livelihood, the courts will subject a covenant by an employee not to compete with their former employer to an overriding limitation of reasonableness.
  - Such covenants by physicians are, if reasonable in scope, generally given effect. It is firmly established doctrine that a member of one of the learned professions, upon becoming assistant to another member thereof, may, upon a sufficient consideration, bind themselves not to engage in the practice of their profession upon the termination of their contract of employment, within a reasonable territorial extent, as such an agreement is not in restraint of trade or against public policy.
  - Courts and commentators explicitly recognize a court’s power of severance and divisibility in order to sustain the covenant insofar as it is reasonable. If in balancing the equities the court decides that the employee’s activity would fit within the scope of a reasonable prohibition, it is apt to make use of the tool of severance, paring an unreasonable restraint down to appropriate size and enforcing it.
    - See *[Karpinski v. Ingrasci](link)*
  - It will generally be found to be reasonable where it simply (1) protects the legitimate interests of the employer, (2) imposes no undue hardships on the employee, and (3) is not injuries to the public.
  - Commercial standards may not be used to evaluate the reasonableness of lawyer restrictive covenants. Strong public policy considerations preclude their applicability.
    - See *[Dwyer v. Jung](link)*

#### Tort Claims Arising Out of Breach of Contract
- Allows for recovery of Punitive Damages
  - Only arises when "duty" to perform contract is done unreasonably or "misfeasance"

#### Inequality of Exchange & Constructive Fraud
  - Rescission of deed was appropriate to remedy constructive fraud resulting from an inadequate price paid by a brother to his sister, her reliance on his advice and judgment, and mutual mistake of fact as to the subject matter of the contract.
  - Status of Parties - Did not deal at "arm's length"
  - But!? Courts Do not inquire to the adequacy of the contract - Freedom to make a good OR bad deal
    - Freedom of Contract being subverted here which invalidates an agreement
      - Court finds ∆ as a "moral jerk" - Moral Baseline not in line with contract
    - See *[Jackson v. Seymour](link)*
    - Contrast against *[Bates Case](link)* - Innocent misrepresentation

### Unconscionability
#### Seminal Case on Unconscionability
- See *[Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.](link)*
  - Unconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Whether a meaningful choice is present in a particular case can only be determined by consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the transaction.
    - **Substantive** Unconscionability = Terms unreasonably favorable to other parties
    - **Procedural** Unsconscionability = Absence of meaningful choice by wronged party, inpropriety in the bargaining process.
      - Confusing Language
      - Bargaining Naughtiness
  - Tension between Freedom of Contract v. Grossly Unfair Deal (If you are aware of it)
    - Legislative action making clauses such as seen in *[Williams](link)* illegal
      - Exploitation paired with racial issues at the time

#### Factors in Unconscionability
- “Cases in which a party takes advantage of the age, lack of sophistication or education, or emotional state of the other party may call out for relief, but still not quite constitute a policing defense”
- Contracts or transfers induced by fraudulent misrepresentation can be avoided.
- Similarly, a lack of legal capacity or the existence of duress can lead a court to declare a promise unenforceable or a transfer voidable.
  - The rule that courts will not weigh consideration or assess the wisdom of bargains, has not fully excluded the opposite proposition, that at some point, courts will do so even in the absence of actual fraud, duress, or incapacity.
  - The deed transfer was unconscionable because the transferee, who had greater knowledge and experience, did not ensure that transferor understood the nature of the transaction; transferee's actions were oppressive and one-sided.
    - See *[Ryan v. Weiner](link)*

#### Substantive Unconscionability & Consumer Protection
- An installment agreement between retailer and husband and wife welfare recipients was found unconscionable due to gross inequality in bargaining power between parties and the actual terms of said agreement and the actual terms of said agreement.
- “striking a term based on substantive unconscionability”
  - See *[Jones v. Star Credit Corp.](link)*
- Ideally Court's do not want to pass price fixing rulings and defer and want legislature to create price policy.

#### UCC
- UCC 2-302: Unconscionability Doctrine
  - Defense in all sale of goods cases
- Distinct from Public Policy
  - Public policy analysis requires court to consider the impact of such arrangements upon society as a whole
  - Unconscionability analysis focuses on the relationship between the parties and the effect of the agreement upon them


#### Contemporary Unconscionability
- “While determinations of unconscionability are ordinarily based on the court’s conclusion that both the procedural and substantive components are present there have been exceptional cases where a provision of the contract is so outrageous as to warrant holding it unenforceable on the ground of substantive unconscionability alone”
  - See *[Chalk v. T-Mobile USA, Inc.](link)*

#### Standard Form Contracts & Adhesion Contracts
- Provision purporting to waive jury trial, which was buried in long paragraph of adhesion contract in tiny type, was not enforceable without evidence that party demanding jury trial had waived the right **knowingly** and **voluntarily**.
- Where parties have been represented by counsel or there was evidene of negotiation without substantial inequality in bargaining positions, or the waiver provisions was conspiuous, the tendency has been to enforce the waiver.
  - See *[Fairfield Leasing Corporation v. Techni-Graphics, Inc.](Link)*

#### Reasonable Expectation
  - Terms that were unread or unknown will invoke doctrine to make insurer bound to what a Reasonable Person would expect
    - Reasonable expectation doctrine is a principle applied in insurance law which states whenever there is an ambiguity in an insurance policy, it is resolved in favor of the insured's reasonable expectations.
    - Dissent
      - See *[C & J Fertilizer, Inc. v. Allied Mutual Insurance Co.](link)*
      - Counter Rule:
        - See *[Markline Co., Inc. Travelers Insurance Co.](link)
      - Restatment - Standardized Agreements
  - Contracts Written in Clear English
    - Appropriately Divided in Sections


#### Policing Electronic Agreements
- Generally Forum Selection Clauses are Valid
  - Policy: Cost of doing business would otherwise be astronomical as litigation would occur around different jurisdictions.
  - Exceptions: Forum Selection Clauses must be done in a certain way
  - “Parties to a written contract have the obligation to read what they sign; and, absent actual or constructive fraud they are not excused from the consequences attendant, “upon a failure to read the contract. The same rule applies to contracts which appear in an electronic format”
  - Other Issues
    - Nobody reads the agreements
    - Forum Shopping
    - Financial Constraints Bringing Suit In New Forum
      - See *[Caspi v. The Microsoft Network](link)*

#### Forum Selection
- Forum Selection Clauses are prima facie valid when a party can show that the clause was incorporated into the parties' contract. However e-commerce merchants cannot bliethly assume that the inclusion of sale terms, listed somewhere on a hyperlinked page on its website will be deemed part of any contract of sale
  - See *[Jerez v. JD Closeouts LLC](Link)*
- Terms must be "reasonably communicated to the user"
  - Separate Download Button & Terms Button
    - See *[Specht](link)*

### Capacity
#### Mental Illness or Defect

#### Infancy/Minors


### Policing Contract Modifications

#### The Hold Out Game
- Contract Modification after a contract has been made, aka hold out rule begins to look like coersion
  - Pre-Existing Duty Rule
    - New Contract then needs to be supported by new consideration
      - See *[Alaska Packers Association v. Domenico](Link)*
        - Lower court: π waived their right to sue upon payment (consideration) of the new contract
        - Appellate Court: Rejected lower court because ∆ were coercing π to engage in new contract. (Duress)
    - Oblgiation to do what you previously had a duty to do is not consideration
      - Defective Nets as consideration for the New K?
        - Rejected because of conflicting evidence.
  - “By hypothesis the parties already have a contract, so that the danger of mistaking casual promissory language for an intention to be legally bound is slight * * *”
    - See *[United States v. Stump Home Specialties MFG., Inc]
  - UCC Modification
    - Agreement modifying a contract needs no consideration to be binding
    - Test of Good Faith Imposed
      - Observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.

#### Modification Limts
- Legitimate reason for modification as well as payment of non-duress consideration will be upheld.
  - Modern Trend away from rigid application of the prexisting duty rule
  - “a seller who believes that changed circumstances entitle the seller to more consideration would not necessarily be “taking advantage” of a promisee that has no market alternatives.”
    - See *[Angel v. Murray](link)*
#### Accord and Satisfaction
- Settlement of Debts between parties = Modifciation and Accord & Satisfication
- Accord & Satisfcation requires an agreement w/ Consideration to Settle a Disputed Amount
  - See *[Flowers v. Diamond Shamrock Corp.]
- Payment Now v. Payment in Whole
  - Requires BonaFide Dispute between Parties
    - See *[Foakes v. Beer](link)*
- Where an amount due is in dispute, and the debtor sends a check for less than the amount claimed, and clearly expresses his intention that the check has been sent as payment in full, and not on account or in part payment, the cashing or retention of the check by the creditor is deemed an acceptance by the creditor of the conditions stated, and operates as an accord and satisfaction of the claim.
- Cannot cash the check and protest the accord and satisfaction
  - Offer as a condition of settlment means that Court **interpret what you DO over what you SAY**
  - See *[Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc. v. Arroll](link)*
