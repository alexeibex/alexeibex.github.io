## Policing Agreements and Promises
- Tensions weighed against *Freedom of Contract*
- Doctrines of Policing Contracts arise under determining Judicial Enforcement of Contract
  - Under what circumstances will courts invalidate contracts that have "legitimately" formed under "basic" Contract formation
### Policing Doctrines
#### Minors
  - The general rule is that the contract of a minor, other than for necessaries, is either void or voidable at his option.”
  - Minors cannot disaffirm contracts for “necessaries” because contract law does not want to discourage people from contracting with minors for goods and services constituting essential needs of the minor.
    - Necessities Include:
      - Food
      - Clothing
      - Shelter
      - Appropriate to the Minor's situation


#### Duress
  - Definition: There must be some threatend exercise of power or authority over a [person's] person or property which can be avoided only by making the payment.
    - π must show that the other party by wrongful acts or threats, intentionally caused the π to involuntarily enter into a particular transaction.
      - See *[Standard Box Co. v. Mutual Biscuit Co.](Link)*
      - "Driving a hard Bargain - Future expectancy is not a legal right on which the plaintiff can anchor a claim of economic duress. There appears to be general acknowledgement that duress is not shown because one party to the contract has driven a hard bargain or that market or other conditions now make the contract more difficult to perform by one of the parties or that financial circumstances may have caused one party to make concessions.
        - See *[Machinery Hauling, Inc. v. Steel of West Viginia](link)*
    - Modern Rule: **Has the person complaining been constrained to do what he otherwise would not have done**?
      - Courts should ignore how the party claiming duress got itself in its precarious position.
      - One person cannot claim to have been placed under duress if they pay money to the defendants for the relief of another person.
        - See *[S.P. Dunham & Co. v. Kudra](link)*
    - Price Gouging
      - Most states have enacted price gouging statutes. Generally, these apply only if the state has declared a state of emergency and a vendor charges an **unconscionable** or **excessive** and **unjustified** price.

#### Undue Influence
  - See [Nicole Hypo](link)
  - In re Baby Boy L., 144 A.D.2d 674, 534 N.Y.S.2d 706 (App. Div. 1988)
  - Lower Court = Duress
    - With reference for the facts at bar nicole's mother was a primary impetus

#### Misrepresentation, Concealment, and the Duty to Disclose
  - Innocent Misrepresentation - Untrue
    - A person seasonably **may rescind** a contract to which they have been induced to become a party in **reliance upon** false though innocent misrepresentations respecting a cognizable **material fact** made of their own knowledge by the other party to the contract.
      - See *[Bates v. Cashman]

#### Misrepresentation and Reasonable Reliance
  - A buyer cannot generally be held to be able to judge the contents of a parcel of land by the eye. Even though a buyer examines land before purchasing, they may normally rely upon the representations of the seller as to measurement.
  - The Benefit-of-the-Bargain Rule: A defrauded purchaser is entitled to the difference between the value the property would have had as represented and the value of the property they actually received.
  - A recovery of exemplary or punitive damages in an action based on fraudulent sale will be allowed ONLY WHERE the fraud is an aggravated one, as where it is malicious, deliberate, gross, or wanton.
    - See *[Holcomb v. Hoffschneider](link)*

#### Limits of Reasonable Reliance
  - Failure to do simple investigation at the time of receiving the ring does not protect against misrepresentation
     - See *[Porreco v. Porreco](link)*

#### Fraudulent Concealment
  - Silence may be fraudulent and relief may be granted to one contractual party where the other suppresses facts which they, under the circumstances, are bound in conscience and duty to disclose to the other party, and in respect to which they cannot, innocently, be silent.
  - If either party to a contract of sale conceals or suppresses a **material** fact which they are in good faith bound to disclose, then the silence is fraudulent.
    - Material = Any Conditions that would make buyer reconsider his purchase and potentially not follow through with the purchase.
  - **Minor conditions** which ordinary sellers and purchasers would reasonably disregard as of little or no materiality in the transaction would clearly not call for judicial intervention.
  - Moral baseline as Cases continued to weigh against Freedom to Contract
    - A duty to speak whenever **justice equity and fair dealing demand it.**
      - Standard leaves a lot of interpretation
      - Criteria of Interptration looks at Market Pricing, Public Information
    - See *[Weintraub v. Krobatsch](link)*
- General Rule: Buyer has no duty to disclose to seller any findings they happen upon.
  - Unless Fraudulent activity is involved
- Exculpatory Clauses
  - Party seeking to enforce a contract with an exculpatory clause has the burden of showing that the provisions were explained to the other party and came to his knowledge and there was in fact a real and voluntary meeting of the minds and not merely an objective meaning.
  - Duty to Explain Agreement or else unbalanced/unfair
    - Prodigious amount of bargaining power on behalf of the stronger party
    - Failure to read the lease upon signing v. Duty to Disclose Unclear Provisions
      - Even with Objective manifestation of Assent Court will invalidate it considering the circumstances
    - Unenforceable as a matter of **Public Policy**
      - See *[Weaver v. American Oil](link)*

#### Public Policy
- Illegal & General Policy the makes Contracts Unenfoceable/Void
- Exculpatory Clauses v. Public Policy
  - Contract Defense to a Torts Claim
    - One who leases a portion of their premises but retains control over the approaches, common passageways, stairways, and other areas to be used in common by the owner and tenants, has a duty to use reasonable care to keep them in safe condition for use of the tenant in their enjoyment of the demised premises.
      - When applied to a specific situation, one may be exempt from liability from his own negligence only when the consequences thereof do not fall greatly below the standard established by law.
      - Decision based on macro public policy and not the indvidiual right to freedom of contract
      - See *[McCutcheon v. United States](link)*
  - Exculpatory agreements in the recreational sports context do not implicate the public interest.
  - Parties may contract that one shall not be liable for their negligence to another but that such other shall assume the risk incident to such negligence
  - An exculpatory provision which specifically and expressly releases a defendant from its own negligence will be upheld, without regard to whether the injury sustained is one typically thought to be inherent in the sport. However, there is a split of authority among the states regarding whether the word ‘negligence’ is even required to be present in the exculpation clause for the provision to be construed as releasing the defendant from its own negligence.

    - See *[Henderson v. Quest Expeditions](link)*

- Non-Compete Clauses
  - Since there are powerful considerations of public policy which militate against sanctioning the loss of a person’s livelihood, the courts will subject a covenant by an employee not to compete with their former employer to an overriding limitation of reasonableness.
  - Such covenants by physicians are, if reasonable in scope, generally given effect. It is firmly established doctrine that a member of one of the learned professions, upon becoming assistant to another member thereof, may, upon a sufficient consideration, bind themselves not to engage in the practice of their profession upon the termination of their contract of employment, within a reasonable territorial extent, as such an agreement is not in restraint of trade or against public policy.
  - Courts and commentators explicitly recognize a court’s power of severance and divisibility in order to sustain the covenant insofar as it is reasonable. If in balancing the equities the court decides that the employee’s activity would fit within the scope of a reasonable prohibition, it is apt to make use of the tool of severance, paring an unreasonable restraint down to appropriate size and enforcing it.
    - See *[Karpinski v. Ingrasci](link)*
  - It will generally be found to be reasonable where it simply (1) protects the legitimate interests of the employer, (2) imposes no undue hardships on the employee, and (3) is not injuries to the public.
  - Commercial standards may not be used to evaluate the reasonableness of lawyer restrictive covenants. Strong public policy considerations preclude their applicability.
    - See *[Dwyer v. Jung](link)*

#### Tort Claims Arising Out of Breach of Contract
- Allows for recovery of Punitive Damages
  - Only arises when "duty" to perform contract is done unreasonably or "misfeasance"



#### Unconscionability

- Unconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Whether a meaningful choice is present in a particular case can only be determined by consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the transaction.
  - See *[Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.](link)*
