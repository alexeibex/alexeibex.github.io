## Conditions

### Conditions
- Conditions Defined: A condition * * * is ‘an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due.’
- Some contingency that must be done in order for some duty of performance to arise.
- Types:
  - Express Conditions Precedent (Order)
    - Implied in Fact (Intent)
    - Implied in law ()
  - Qualitatitve Conditions on Performance (Quality)


#### Condition Implied-in-Law
  - Constructive condition which arises when court comes in and “constructs” condition, because it’s not clear in the contract. (i.e. substantial performance)

#### Condition Implied-in-fact
- Language of contract does not expressly indicate the condition, but its clear enough that it may be inferred as implied-in-fact by the intention of the parties.
  - Implied-in-fact and express condition are treated the same way. One is implied based on circumstances and facts of situation/suggestive language of contract, while one is expressly given. Both are treated as conditions precedent
  - Look at past dealings to see if your promise to pay is like what has happened before. If it is not expressly stated and get it from the surrounding circumstances-its just like getting it directly, but through implied in fact.

#### Order of Performance
- Express Promissory Condition Pre(e)cedent
  - Condition that one must occur before the other (Dependent/Independent)
    - “A condition is customarily an undertaking on one side to do something (Thing One) which, by its terms, is made a condition to the performance of some corresponding obligation (Thing Two) by the other party, as where the latter agrees to do Thing Two if the former shall carry out Thing One.”)”
  - Express conditions are those agreed to and imposed by the parties themselves


#### Express Conditions
##### Creation of an Express Condition
-“As a general rule, conditions which are either expressed or implied in fact must be exactly fulfilled or no liability can arise on the promise which such conditions qualify.”
- “While no particular words are necessary for the existence of a condition, such terms as ‘if,’ ‘provide that,’ ‘on condition that,’ or some other phrase that conditions performance, usually connote an intent for a condition rather than a promise”
- Plain Language Interpretation

##### Promissory & Pure Conditions Conditions
- Pure condition with no promise made
  - See *[Merritt Hill Vineyards Inc. v. Windy Heights Vineyard Inc.](link)*

##### Condition Construction
- When a condition precedent is not expressed, court may construct condition of substantial performance on equitable relief.
  - An implied-in-law condition of substantial performance, which does not require 100% absolute copy of contract. Partly on fairness and partly on presumable intent.
    - Quality of Performance
      - Implied in Law: Substantial performance has been met
      - Strict compliance is not required absent an express condition precedent
    - Damages: economic waste argument won over the cost of completion argument.
      - See *[Jacob & Young Inc. v. Kent](Link)*
        - Cardozo: Extending Judicial Overreach to allow for flexibility within contracts
        - Concern over forfeiture & fairness
        - “We must weigh the purpose to be served, the desire to be gratified, the excuse for deviation from the letter, the cruelty of enforced adherence. Then only can we tell whether literal fulfilment is to be implied by law as a condition * * *. [T]he law will be slow to impute the purpose, in the silence of the parties, where the significance of the default is grievously out of proportion to the oppression of the forfeiture.”
          - Construing what would be equitable and fair
        - Factors To Consider
          - Purpsoe to be served
          - Desire to be gratified
          - The excuse for deviation from the letter
          - the cruelty of enforced adherence

##### Substantial Performance
- See *[Brown-Marx Associates, Ltd. v. Emigrant Sav. Bank](link)*
  - Literal and strict compliance follows any express condition precedent.
  - Substantial performance cannot apply when there is an express condition precedent.
  - Cannot Frustrate the **Intent** of the parties.
- Restatement §237 - Substantial Performance
  - Material Breach != Substantial Performance


#### Interpretation of Contract Lanuage to Determine Whether it Creates an Express Condition
  - Courts to look at the language of the alleged express condition on its face.
  - Courts look at the intent of the parties to determine conditions v. promises
  - Remidial Difficulties can sway courts to decide conditions v. promises
    - See *[Glaholm v. Hays](link)*

- Restatement §227
  - Courts typically lean toward promises over conditions in order to avoid forfeiture
    - See *[Howard v. Federal Crop Ins. Corp.](link)*
      - Without express condition precedent language there is a presumption that it’s a conditional promise. But when it can go either way, the court. must explore a number of factors to figure it out. It can end up being a question of fact.
      - Factors to consider:
        - Intention of parties;
        - consequence of condition’s failure;
        - purpose of the clause;
        - customs etc.

##### Interpretation of the Content of Express Conditions
- Objective v. Subjective
  - Subjective
    - With contracts based on conditions of taste, it’s a subjective standard and court will not question it.
    - Subjective standard as a condition is valid if agreed to expressly by both parties.
      - See *[Gibson v. Cranage](link)*
        - “Artists or third parties might consider a portrait an excellent one, and yet it prove very unsatisfactory to the person who had ordered it and who might be unable to point out with clearness or certainty the defects or objections.”
        - Limitation on subjective satisfaction is GOOD FAITH.
  - Objective
    - Courts will favor a reasonableness standard when the contract concerns matters capable of objective evaluation.
      - However, where the circumstances are such that it is clear the provision was added as a personal concession to one of the contracting parties, the subjective, rather than the objective standard should be applied.
        - See *[Forman v. Benson](link)*
          - Attempted renegotiation demonstrates that his rejection was based on reasons other than plaintiff’s credit rating and was, therefore, in bad faith.

- Literal Interpretation of Content of Express Conditions
  - A condition precedent is a fact or event which the parties intend must exist or take place before there is a right to performance.
    - See *[Luttinger v. Rosen](link)*

#### Impossibility
- See *[Hanna v. Commmercial Travelers Mutual Accident Association](link)*
  - 

#### Restatement of Contracts 261 – Interpretation of doubtful words as promise or condition
- Where it is doubtful whether words create a promise or an express condition, they are interpreted as creating a promise; but the same words may sometimes mean that one party promises a performance and that the other party’s promise is conditioned on that performance.







- Courts are cautious when interpreting a contractual clause as a condition precedent, and they will ‘interpret doubtful language as embodying a promise or constructive condition rather than an express condition
