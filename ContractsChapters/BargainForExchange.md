## Bargain Theory For Enforcing Promises & The Requirement of Agreement
- Principle reason for enforcing contract law is based on a "bargained for exchange"
  - Agreement to exchange a piano for $400 dollars = Legally Binding Contract
  - A promise to make a gift of a piano != Legally Binding Contract

### Bargain Theory of Consideration
#### Bargain for Exchanges v. Gift Promise
- Bargain for Exchange
  - Promisor requires something from the promisee in return for the promise = **Consideration**
- Simple Gift Promise
  - Promisor gets nothing in return for their promise = No Consideration
- Distinction between bargain for exchange and Gift Promise is in the motive
- A promisor's gratitude for the promisee's past good conduct or services does not = Consideration
  - Promisor is not extracting and promisee is not supplying anything as the price of the promisor's promise.
    - See *[Dougherty v. Salt](link)*
      - Where Promisor did not make her promise with the motive of extracting anything from the promisee in return; therefore held that promise was unenforceable gift promise.
- Contract law measures the promisor's motive objectively
  - A reasonable person must believe that your motive for making the promise was to obtain the return promise in exchange
  - **Actual motive is irrelevant**
- Promisor' motive for obtaining something in return for the promise (as determined objectively) does not have to be the primary or even a substantial reason for making the promise.

#### What must be extracted
- Promisor must bargain for either a return promise or performance = Consideration
  - Executory Bilateral Exchange = Promise for a promise = Consideration
    - Each party is both promisor and promisee
- Promise can extract a performance for a promise = Consideration
  - Performance = Acts or Forbearance
    - Act = Payment
    - Forbearance = desisting from exercising one's legal rights
      - See *[Hammer v. Sidway](link)*

#### Forbearance to Sue as Consideration
- Forbearance from pursuing a claim constitued adequate consideration
  - See *[Springstead v. Nees](link)*
  - Claim must be valid or else begins to resemble extortion
    - If promisor knows claim is invalid then no consideration
      - Exception if "colorable" & "doubtful"

#### Poliices Behind Enforcing Bargained-For-Exchanges
- Fulller: Formal and Substantive Grounds for Enforcing bargain-for-exchanges
  - Formal Basis: Examines the "circumstances surrounding" the making of a promise include the evidentiary, cautionary, and channeling functions of consideration
    - Evidentiary: Enforcing Bargain-For-Exchanges satisfies the need for evidentiary security
      - Tends to product evidence that promises were really made
    - Cautionary: Bargain-for-exchange cautions parties as to the seriousness of their exchange
      - People make gift promises all the time
    - Channeling: Bargain-For-Exchange offers parties a recognizeable method of entering into contracts
      - Distinct set of instructions for entering into an enforcable exchange
  - Substantive Basis: Characteristics and Importance of exchanges
    - Private Autonomy: Freedom to contract and exchange
    - Reliance: Bargained-For-Exchange protects peolpe who rely on promises
      - Also protects partial performance of parties
  - Gift-Promises do not contribute to the production of wealth and division of labor as much as exchange transactions.
    - Exchange Transactions > Gift Promises
    - Further, Gift Promises may lose their value if they are legally enforceable. No one would give gifts.

#### Adequacy of Consideration
- Principle of Contract Law: Courts are not supposed to weigh the adequacy of Consideration.
  - Parties should be left to determine what something is worth and 3rd parties should not interfere.
  - See *[Hardesty v. Smith](link)
  - Inadequacy of Consideration is a RED FLAG
    - One party may have taken advantage at the contract formation stage and is therefore invalid
      - Invitation for courts to police agreements if deemed unfair

#### Mutuality of Obligation and Illusory Promises
- Illusory promise = No Promise at All
  - Agreement lacks an obligation on a party because they have not promised to deliver anything in exchange.
  - Example = $400 for piano in exchange for a statement to sell piano "if you want to.." = No Contract
- Question often boils down to whether a promise is **real or illusory**
  - See *[De Los Santos v. Great Western Sugar Company](link)*
- Illusory Language in appearence only but still ends up committing parties because of "reasonable efforts"
  - A Promise may be lacking, yet the entire writing may be "instinct with obligation" imperfectly expressed, if so then there is a contract.
  - See *[Wood v. Lucy Lady Duff-Gordon](link)*
- Satisfaction Clauses interpreted with a "good faith" requirement on the part of the promisor who must be satisfied.
  - Decision about satisfaction must be reasonable and honest
    - If regarding commercial value or quality, operative fitness, or mechanical utility, courts generally apply reasonable test.
      - Satisfaction can be easily compared to other market alternatives
    - If involves fancy taste or judgement then courts use honesty test.
    - See *[Mattei v. Hopper](link)*

#### Preexisting Duty Doctrine, Accord and Satisfaction


#### Promise for Benefit Received
- Contract law declines to enforce such promises based on the promise-for-benefit-received theory (Past Consideration)
  - See *[Mills v. Wyman](link)*
- Subsequent Promises can result in consideration for a past consideration
  - See *[Webb v. McGowin](link)*
- Promises made in recognition of a benefit previously received by the promisor from the promisee is binding to the extent necessary to prevent injustice.
  - Promises are not binding if the promisee intended to make a gift of the benefit or if the promisor has not been unjustly enriched
  - Value of the benefit must also not be disproportionate to the benefit


#### Summary
- Issues:
  - Courts investigate the adequacy of consideration even though exchange is supposed to be up to the parties
  - Line between gift promises and those supported by consideration is not clear
  - Courts manipulate pre-existing duty doctrine based on whether they believe a promise was voluntary.
  - Courts enforce some promises based on "past consideration"
- Issues allow courts to expand promise enforcement as circumstances change and as justice and fairness require
