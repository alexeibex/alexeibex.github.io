## Measure of Damages for a Breach of Contract

### Measure of Expectations Damages
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in **if the contract had performed**.
    - You get what you bargained for.
  - Compensatory Damages
    - Monetary Damages
    - Courts will generally not order specific performance when money damages are adequate
  - Expectation Damages are the difference between **promised performance and actual performance**
    - Breach of Contract to Perform Services
  - Two remedies
      - **Cost of Completion**
        - If a contracter leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover **cost of completion**.
  - Breach of Contract for the Sale of Goods
    - UCC Governs
      - Seller's Breach
        - Specfic Relief & Damages
    - [*Hawkins v. McGee*](LINK)

### Objective v. Subjective Reward of Expectation Damages
- **Cost-to-Complete**
  - Cost-of-completion damages will sometimes put the owner in a better economic position than he would have been in if the contract had been fully performed. The factfinder should determine whether the owner is likely to pocket the difference or actually put it towards repairs.
  - If a contractor leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover cost of completion damages.
    - [Groves v. John Wunder Co.](Link)
  - Environmental Statutes
    - [Rock Island Improvement Company v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.](Link)
  - Intent of π to use funds won to complete said contract
    - Begins to look like specific performance
    - [Radford v. De Froberville](Link)


- **Diminuation in Value**
  - Where cost of performance exceeds diminuation (grossly dispraportionate) in value, courts are likely to award damages only for diminuation in value. (subjective value)
  - "The cost of remedying the defects is grossly proportionate to the benefits . . .”
  - The court affirmed Peevyhouse, despite recent statutory revisions. “ . . . where the cost is grossly disproportionate to the cost of reclamation as in Peevyhouse, a review of recent case law suggests that courts are adhering to the diminution in value award"
    - [Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining Co.](Link)
  - Diminished value damages should be measured at the date of the breach, not the original date of the contract.
- **Cost-of-completion and diminished-value** damages are not the only possibilities.
  - The measure should be “the loss truly suffered by the promisee.”
- **Factors to Consider and Influence Damages**
  - Asthetics + Good-Faith
    - When the damages are aesthetically important, and when the builder does not act in good faith, the diminution in value rule does not apply. Rather, the owner can recover the full cost of repair.
  - Waste
    - Paying the full cost of restoration would be “a useless and wasteful expenditure of funds . .
  - Residential v. Commercial
    - . . . a distinction exists between a contract to construct a dwelling for the owner who plans to live therein and a contract to construct a commercial structure where the aesthetic taste of the owner is not so deeply involved.
  - Pleasure and Amenity
    - Cost-of-completion and diminished-value damages are not the only possibilities. The measure should be “the loss truly suffered by the promisee.”


### Formulas for Measuring Damages
- There are two formulae for calculating a contractor’s damages from the owner’s breach:
 - (a) Contractor’s expenses + contractor’s lost profits - amount paid by owner prior to breach. Aiello.
 - Contract price - cost of completion that the contractor saved - amount paid by owner prior to breach.
   - (Restatement Second § 346.)
 - The two are algebraically equivalent, but courts usually use the second.
- Owner’s damages for builder’s breach
  -Reasonable Cover - Contract Price
    - [Thorne v. White](Link)
  - The amount the builder owes the owner = (total cost of completion) - (total original contract price - amount the owner already paid builder).
    - [Morello v. J.H. Hogan, Inc.](Link)
- Profit Damages
  - Contract price - cost of completion that the contractor saved - amount paid by owner prior to breach.
    - Restatement Second § 346.
  - Profit rewarded because of implied in the reliance of party on the contract


#### Examination of actual benefit for determining Damages
  - Measure of Damages != Cost of performance v. Extent of harm by non-performance
    - [Freund v. Washington Square Press]
      - Cost to publish books v. Injury to the party was loss of royalties
        - Revise contract "I want the books published" v. "I want the royalties of the books sold that are published"

#### Efficient Breach
  - [Handicapped Children's Education Board of Sheboygan County v. Lukaszewski](link)
    - “expectancy damages correctly encourage a party to breach when the breach is efficient, in that the breach makes some parties better off without making anyone worse off”
    - Posner on Efficient Breach
      - Theory of efficient breach: “breach of contract is efficient, and therefore desirable, if the promisor’s gain from breach, after payment of expectation damages, will exceed promisee’s loss from breach.”
    - Factoring all fees and added costs is it really efficient?
    - Breaching party takes the risk of not knowing what the nonbreaching party may have to pay for a replacement.
  -[Tongish v. Thomas](link)
    - Resale paradigm: A agrees to sell 100,000 widgets to B at $1 a piece. After A delivers 10,000 widgets, C says he desperately needs 25,000 wid- gets, and he’s willing to pay $2 a piece. A agrees to sell to C. He makes a $1,250 profit on C’s order, but it delays B’s order, causing B $1,000 in damages. But even after paying expectation damages to B, A’s breach still earned a profit of $250.181
    - Fuller and Eisenberg challenge the theory in the context of the Overbidder Paradigm, in which a seller breaches a contract with a buyer in favor of a sale with another buyer willing to pay more. They contend that efficient breach is inefficient in this case for three reasons:
        - (a) It remakes the parties’ contract into a contract that allows and encourages sellers to seek overbidders.
        - (b) It would reduce rewards for planning and investment.
        - (c) It undermines the **morality of promise keeping.**
          - Requires **Good Faith Reason** (Allied where raisins were destroyed v. Tongish where breach was willful)
    - UCC 2-712
    - UCC 2-706
    - UCC 2-708
    - UCC 2-714: Measure 1 = Breach of Contract Warranty - Accepted Value of goods


#### Recovery for Lost Profits under the UCC
- See *[Neri v. Retail Marine Corp.](link)*
  - **Lost Volume Seller: Measure of Damages = Contract Price - Construction Costs - Expenses  + Profit**
    - A lost volume seller has the capacity to meet every potential sales order.
    - Read literally, the last clause of 2-708(2)—“due credit for payments or proceeds of resale” — prevents a seller from recovering from a buyer in breach if the seller can sell the item to another buyer for the same price.
    - However, in transactions with lost volume sellers, the buyer should not be credited with proceeds from the second sale, because the lost volume seller would have been able to make two profits instead of one.
    - What is the proper definition of “lost volume seller”? Courts often assume that a lost volume seller is one with “the capacity to supply the breached units in addition to what it actually sold.” But courts should also focus on whether it would be profitable for the seller to produce both units. At some point, it no longer becomes profitable for the lost volume seller to produce additional units. Thus, in some cases, awarding lost profits to lost volume sellers will result in overcompensation.

#### Duty to Mitigate Damages
- "The duty to mitigate damages requires an injured party to act reasonably after breach”
  - See *[Schiavi Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Gironda](Link)*
- "Before projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation, the employer must show that the other employment was comparable, or substantially similar, to that of which the employee has been deprived; the employee’s rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages.""
  - See *[Parker v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp](link)
- Lost Volume Sellers Duty to Mitigate
  - See *[In Re WorldCom, Inc.](link)*


Excerpt From: Robert Hillman. “Principles of Contract Law, 3d (Concise Hornbook Series).” Apple Books.


### Restatement Second § 347: Measure of Damages in General
- A contracts to build a house for B for $100,000. B breaches halfway through. A would have to spend $60,000 to finish. A’s damages are the contract price ($100,000) - cost of completion that the contractor saved ($60,000) = $40,000. A can recover $40,000 minus any payments already made.

## Reliance
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract **had not been made.**
  - Reliance Damages
    - Appropriate measure of damages is the difference between:
      - (Performance of the contract as promised) - (the Actual Performance) = Cost Incurred
    - When there are no **measureable lost profits** reliance may be the only way to avoid injustice.
  - [Sullivan v. O'Connor](https://alexeibex.github.io/Contracts#case-sullivan-v-oconnor)
---

## Restitution
  - Restores to the promisee any benefit he conferred to the promisor.
  - The non-breaching party will sometimes be satisfied with rescission of the contract and restitution of any value conferred on the breaching party. The purpose of restitution is to prevent unjust enrichment.
  - Restitution damages are based on benefit incurred.
  - [**Unjust enrichment**](Link): measured by the benefit the plaintiff conferred on the defendant.
  - [Quantum meruit](Link): measured by the value of the plaintiff’s services. The plaintiff can recover even if performance of the contract would have resulted in a loss.
  - Restitution vs. Quantum meruit
    - Example: Bank Error in your favor
      - Under Restitution: You must give the money back. Otherwise, Unjust enrichment
      - Quantum meruit: The bank can recover nothing because it did not render any service of value.
  - Modern Trend to allow breaching party to recover for benefit conferred (minus actual injury)
    - “ . . . the breaching party is entitled to the reasonable value of its services less any damages caused by the breach.”
    - " . . . a party injured by breach of contract is entitled to retain nothing in excess of that sum which compensates him for the loss of his bargain.”
---

## The Universal Commercial Code
  - UCC tries to make promisee whole + incurred costs “for goods”
  - Article 1 - Remedies to be liberally Administered
    - Compensatory Damages + Search Costs
  - Article 2 of the UCC
    - Applies to “Transactions in goods”
    - “Goods” includes “all things” which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale

---

## Nominal
  - Small amount of award where the ∆ is in breach but the π has suffered no quantifiable loss.
    - Legal record of who is at fault





---

## Case Headnotes
- Groves v. John Wunder Co.
  - In reckoning damages for breach of a building or construction contract, the law aims to give the disappointed promisee, so far as money will do it, what he was promised.
  - Even in case of substantial performance in good faith, the resulting defects being remediable, it is error to instruct that the measure of damage is the difference in value between the house as it was and as it would have been if constructed according to contract. The correct doctrine is that the cost of remedying the defect is the proper measure of damages

## Problems

#### 3-2 page 284
- π = Edgar Janis (Non breaching party)
- ∆ = Addis Corp. (Breaching Party)
- K = 1 Year Employment Contract - $1500/month
  - Market Value of Services was $1200 per month
- Facts: Worked 1 month, and then terminated
  - Diligent Search for 10 months until he took a comparable job for comparable pay
- Rule: When a employer wrongfully terminates an employee, π is entitled to any unpaid salary up to the time of the breach and the salary for the remaining term.
- Damages = Lost Expectancy
  - At the time of breach π had been paid for 1 month.
  - Final month of year π had a job of comparable status & salary
  - **π damages = K price - π earnings ** + (reasonable search costs)
    - π must try to minimize damages.
    - Deduct from recovery any salary she makes or could have made by accepting a reasonable substitute for employment.

#### 3-3
- π Norgaard (NonBreaching Party)
- ∆ Anderson (Breaching Party)
- K = Realestate Contract: Morning of May 7th, buy a farm for $125,000 on July 15th.
- Facts:
  - Evening of May 7th, ∆ changed his minde and gave notice to π.
  - Fair market value of house is $122,000
  - π tried without sucess to resell to others for $125,000
- Remedies Formula: **Damages = Contract Price for House - Market Value of House**
- Rule: Under Section 708 π can recover the contract price market differential if π resells the farm in good faith.
  - Market Fluctuations for a property will be upheld
    - Policy notions regarding contract's validity
    - Court take a hardline on "backing out of deals"
  -

#### 3-4
“The “cover” price is the price of the substitute purchase.) If the substitute purchase is “in good faith,” is “without unreasonable delay,” and is otherwise reasonable”
“section 2–712(1) says the buyer “may” cover, suggesting that the section is optional and that Alice can recover under section 2–713”
- Formula = Contract Price - Market Price
