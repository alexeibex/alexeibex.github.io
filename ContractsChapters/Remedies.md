## Measure of Damages for a Breach of Contract

### Measure of Expectations Damages
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in **if the contract had performed**.
    - You get what you bargained for.
  - Compensatory Damages
    - Monetary Damages
    - Courts will generally not order specific performance when money damages are adequate
  - Expectation Damages are the difference between **promised performance and actual performance**
    - Breach of Contract to Perform Services
  - Two remedies
      - **Cost of Completion**
        - If a contracter leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover **cost of completion**.
  - Breach of Contract for the Sale of Goods
    - UCC Governs
      - Seller's Breach
        - Specfic Relief & Damages
    - [*Hawkins v. McGee*](LINK)

### Objective v. Subjective Reward of Expectation Damages
- **Cost-to-Complete**
  - Cost-of-completion damages will sometimes put the owner in a better economic position than he would have been in if the contract had been fully performed. The factfinder should determine whether the owner is likely to pocket the difference or actually put it towards repairs.
  - If a contractor leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover cost of completion damages.
    - [Groves v. John Wunder Co.](Link)
  - Environmental Statutes
    - [Rock Island Improvement Company v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.](Link)
  - Intent of π to use funds won to complete said contract
    - Begins to look like specific performance
    - [Radford v. De Froberville](Link)


- **Diminuation in Value**
  - Where cost of performance exceeds diminuation (grossly dispraportionate) in value, courts are likely to award damages only for diminuation in value. (subjective value)
  - "The cost of remedying the defects is grossly proportionate to the benefits . . .”
  - The court affirmed Peevyhouse, despite recent statutory revisions. “ . . . where the cost is grossly disproportionate to the cost of reclamation as in Peevyhouse, a review of recent case law suggests that courts are adhering to the diminution in value award"
    - [Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining Co.](Link)
  - Diminished value damages should be measured at the date of the breach, not the original date of the contract.
- **Cost-of-completion and diminished-value** damages are not the only possibilities.
  - The measure should be “the loss truly suffered by the promisee.”
- **Factors to Consider and Influence Damages**
  - Asthetics + Good-Faith
    - When the damages are aesthetically important, and when the builder does not act in good faith, the diminution in value rule does not apply. Rather, the owner can recover the full cost of repair.
  - Waste
    - Paying the full cost of restoration would be “a useless and wasteful expenditure of funds . .
  - Residential v. Commercial
    - . . . a distinction exists between a contract to construct a dwelling for the owner who plans to live therein and a contract to construct a commercial structure where the aesthetic taste of the owner is not so deeply involved.
  - Pleasure and Amenity
    - Cost-of-completion and diminished-value damages are not the only possibilities. The measure should be “the loss truly suffered by the promisee.”


### Formulas for Measuring Damages
- There are two formulae for calculating a contractor’s damages from the owner’s breach:
 - (a) Contractor’s expenses + contractor’s lost profits - amount paid by owner prior to breach. Aiello.
 - Contract price - cost of completion that the contractor saved - amount paid by owner prior to breach.
   - (Restatement Second § 346.)
 - The two are algebraically equivalent, but courts usually use the second.
- Owner’s damages for builder’s breach
  -Reasonable Cover - Contract Price
    - [Thorne v. White](Link)
  - The amount the builder owes the owner = (total cost of completion) - (total original contract price - amount the owner already paid builder).
    - [Morello v. J.H. Hogan, Inc.](Link)
- Profit Damages
  - Contract price - cost of completion that the contractor saved - amount paid by owner prior to breach.
    - Restatement Second § 346.
  - Profit rewarded because of implied in the reliance of party on the contract


#### Examination of actual benefit for determining Damages
  - Measure of Damages != Cost of performance v. Extent of harm by non-performance
    - [Freund v. Washington Square Press]
      - Cost to publish books v. Injury to the party was loss of royalties
        - Revise contract "I want the books published" v. "I want the royalties of the books sold that are published"

#### Efficient Breach
  - [Handicapped Children's Education Board of Sheboygan County v. Lukaszewski](link)
    - “expectancy damages correctly encourage a party to breach when the breach is efficient, in that the breach makes some parties better off without making anyone worse off”
    - Posner on Efficient Breach
      - Theory of efficient breach: “breach of contract is efficient, and therefore desirable, if the promisor’s gain from breach, after payment of expectation damages, will exceed promisee’s loss from breach.”
    - Factoring all fees and added costs is it really efficient?
    - Breaching party takes the risk of not knowing what the nonbreaching party may have to pay for a replacement.
  -[Tongish v. Thomas](link)
    - Resale paradigm: A agrees to sell 100,000 widgets to B at $1 a piece. After A delivers 10,000 widgets, C says he desperately needs 25,000 wid- gets, and he’s willing to pay $2 a piece. A agrees to sell to C. He makes a $1,250 profit on C’s order, but it delays B’s order, causing B $1,000 in damages. But even after paying expectation damages to B, A’s breach still earned a profit of $250.181
    - Fuller and Eisenberg challenge the theory in the context of the Overbidder Paradigm, in which a seller breaches a contract with a buyer in favor of a sale with another buyer willing to pay more. They contend that efficient breach is inefficient in this case for three reasons:
        - (a) It remakes the parties’ contract into a contract that allows and encourages sellers to seek overbidders.
        - (b) It would reduce rewards for planning and investment.
        - (c) It undermines the **morality of promise keeping.**
          - Requires **Good Faith Reason** (Allied where raisins were destroyed v. Tongish where breach was willful)
    - UCC 2-712
    - UCC 2-706
    - UCC 2-708
    - UCC 2-714: Measure 1 = Breach of Contract Warranty - Accepted Value of goods


#### Recovery for Lost Profits under the UCC 708
- See *[Neri v. Retail Marine Corp.](link)*
  - **Lost Volume Seller: Measure of Damages = Contract Price - Construction Costs - Expenses + Profits**
  - A lost volume seller has the capacity to meet every potential sales order.
    - Read literally, the last clause of 2-708(2)—“due credit for payments or proceeds of resale”
      — Prevents a seller from recovering from a buyer in breach if the seller can sell the item to another buyer for the same price.
      - Intended for Junk value when it is manifestly useless to complete the operation of manufacture.
    - However, in transactions with lost volume sellers, the buyer should not be credited with proceeds from the second sale, because the lost volume seller would have been able to make two profits instead of one.
    - What is the proper definition of “lost volume seller”? Courts often assume that a lost volume seller is one with “the **capacity to supply the breached units** in addition to what it actually sold.”
      - But courts should also focus on whether it would be profitable for the seller to produce both units. At some point, it no longer becomes profitable for the lost volume seller to produce additional units. Thus, in some cases, awarding lost profits to lost volume sellers will result in overcompensation.

### Availability of Lost Expectancy Damages, Qualifications and Limits

- Limits on Expectancy Damages
  - See *[See Hadley v. Baxendale](Link)*
    - **Hadley Rules: Two Rules**
      - General Damages = Market value of the very thing promised at the time of performance
      - Consequentail Damages = Damages that would **reasonably foreseeable** so known and communicated at the time the contract is formed.
        - Application of reasonable knowledge
          - See *[Armstrong v. Bangor Mill Supply Corp.](link)*
            - Mill repair man could reasonably foresee that broken mill crank would inhibit mill from working and generating profits.
    - Creates an incentive to fully disclose information at the time of K formation
    - Codified in UCC 2-715(2)(a)
    - Restatement §351 Limit on Hadley Rule
      - Court may limit damages for foreseeable loss by exluding recover for loss of profits
        - Allowing recovery only for loss incurred in reliance or if it concludes that as justice requires to avoid **disproportionate compensation**
- Mitigation of Damages as a result of the breach
  - See *[Clark v. Marsiglia](Link)*
    - K = Profit + Expenses
      - Damages should not be awarded for expenses and labor occuring after the breach
      - Foundation for mitigation of losses by **acting reasonably**
- Mitigation of Lost Volume Seller
  - See *[Schiavi Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Gironda](Link)*
    - Must take **reasonable steps to mitigate** != Must selling to the ∆
    - Evidence must show that they at least **tried**
    - Not a lost volume seller because sale to father was a substitution in lieu of son's default
    - "The duty to mitigate damages requires an injured party to act reasonably after breach”
  - See *[Parker v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp](link)
    - "Before projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation, the employer must show that the other employment was comparable, or substantially similar, to that of which the employee has been deprived; the employee’s rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages."
    - Reasonableness of mitigation for employee to take comperable and substantially similar
      - Dissent Test: Differences should be for the **kind of employment** v. **mere circumstances**








#### Duty to Mitigate Damages

  - See *[Schiavi Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Gironda](Link)*


- Lost Volume Sellers Duty to Mitigate
  - See *[In Re WorldCom, Inc.](link)*


Excerpt From: Robert Hillman. “Principles of Contract Law, 3d (Concise Hornbook Series).” Apple Books.


### Restatement Second § 347: Measure of Damages in General
- A contracts to build a house for B for $100,000. B breaches halfway through. A would have to spend $60,000 to finish. A’s damages are the contract price ($100,000) - cost of completion that the contractor saved ($60,000) = $40,000. A can recover $40,000 minus any payments already made.





---

## Reliance
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract **had not been made.**
  - Reliance Damages
    - Appropriate measure of damages is the difference between:
      - (Performance of the contract as promised) - (the Actual Performance) = Cost Incurred
    - When there are no **measureable lost profits** reliance may be the only way to avoid injustice.
  - [Sullivan v. O'Connor](https://alexeibex.github.io/Contracts#case-sullivan-v-oconnor)

### Liquidation Damages


- Agreed Estimation of Damages/Remedies made at the time of the contract formation.
  - Most courts apply some variation of two tests, both of which must be satisfied. (Restatement § 339)
    - First, the agreed damages must be **a reasonable forecast of just compensation** of just compensation for the harm that is caused by the breach.
    - Second, the harm that is caused by the breach is one that is incapable or very difficult of accurate estimation.
    - See *[H. J. McGrath Co. v. Wisner](Link)*
    - See *[Vanderbilt University v. DiNardo](Link)*
- Performance in Good faith
  - See *[Truck Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Puritan Farms 2nd, Inc.](link)*
- Underliquidated Damages
  - Under liquidated damages — anamount less than actual estimated damages are usually enforced.
    - Justified because you are taking a risk. you could get more you could also get less.
- Policy Reasons
  - "Compeling" performances so that parties do not breach contract but must not "coerce"
- See *[H. J. McGrath Co. v. Wisner ](Link)*

- Limitation Damages v. Liquidation Damages
-
  - Hillman: Let parties contract and enjoy freedom of contracts


#### Monetary Remedies Where the Theory of Obligation is Promissory Estoppel
- Restatement § 90
- See *[Goodman v. Dicker](Link)*
  - No profits awarded because π did not demonstrate any expectation of potential sales.
- See *[Walters v. Marathon Oil Co.](Link)*
  - Foregone opportunity doctrine
- See *[Walters v. Marathon Oil Co.](Link)*
  - The Walters reasonably relied on Marathon’s promise to let them open a dealrship. The court awarded remedies to put the Walters in the position they would have been in if the contract had been performed (expectation damages).
---

## Restitution
- Restores to the promisee any benefit he conferred to the promisor.
- The non-breaching party will sometimes be satisfied with rescission of the contract and restitution of any value conferred on the breaching party. The purpose of restitution is to prevent unjust enrichment.
- Restitution damages are based on benefit incurred.
- [**Unjust enrichment**](Link): measured by the benefit the plaintiff conferred on the defendant.
- [Quantum meruit](Link): measured by the value of the plaintiff’s services. The plaintiff can recover even if performance of the contract would have resulted in a loss.
- Restitution vs. Quantum meruit
  - Example: Bank Error in your favor
    - Under Restitution: You must give the money back. Otherwise, Unjust enrichment
    - Quantum meruit: The bank can recover nothing because it did not render any service of value.
- Modern Trend to allow breaching party to recover for benefit conferred (minus actual injury)
  - “ . . . the breaching party is entitled to the reasonable value of its services less any damages caused by the breach.”
  - " . . . a party injured by breach of contract is entitled to retain nothing in excess of that sum which compensates him for the loss of his bargain.”


#### Restatement Contracts §371
- a. the reasonable value to the other party of what he received in terms of what it would have cost him to obtain it from a person in the claimant's position or
- b.

- The Promisee upon breach has the option to forego any suit of contract and claim only reasonable value of their performance.
- See *[United States For Use of Susi Contracting Co. v. Zara Contracting Co.](link)*
  - Remedy on the contract v. remedy based on restitution
  - The contract price or the unit price per cubic yard of a construction or excavation contract does not limit recovery. A plaintiff may well have completed the hardest part of a job for which an average cost had been set. With the breach fall all the other parts of the contract. Hence it is clear that plaintiffs are not limited to the contract prices in the situation disclosed here.
  - The measure of recovery by way of restitution, though often confused with recovery on the contract, should not be measured or limited thereby; but he does point out that the contract may be important evidence of the value of the performance to the defendant, as may also the cost of the labor and materials.
  - It is to be valued, not by the extent to which the defendant’s total wealth has been increased thereby, but by  the  amount  for which such services  and materials as  constituted  the part performance could have been purchased from one in the plaintiff’s position at the time they were rendered.
- Exception to Restitution (Exception to Susi Rule)
  - The remedy of restitution in money is not available to one who has (**essentially**) fully performed his part of a contract, if the only part of the agreed exchange for such performance that has not be rendered by the defendant is a sum of money constituting a liquidated debt.
  - Anomolous Results in that the less work done = the more recovery can be entitled to when breaching and suing off the contract with restitution.
    - See *[Oliver v. Campbell](link)*

### Losing Contract
- A  plaintiff  may  recover  from  a  defaulting  defendant  the  cost  of  labor  and  materials  less payments made, although such cost exceeds the price fixed in the contract.
- Where the owners breached the contractby refusing to make required payments to builder, builder was entitled to recover the reasonable value of their services, but the contract price constituted a ceiling on their recovery of restitution. Courts are divided over the question of whether restitution should be limited by the contract.
  - See *[City of Philadelphia v. Tripple](link)*

Problem 3-15

- The non-breaching party will sometimes be satisfied with rescission of the contract and restitution of any value conferred on the breaching party. The purpose of restitution is to prevent unjust enrichment.
  - See *[Osteen v. Johnson](link)*


---

## Specific Performance
#### Restatement of Contracts §363
- Specific performance or an injunction will be refused if a substantial part of the agreed exchange has been unperformed and its performance is not secured to the satisfaction of the court.
- According to general view today, buyer of land is entitled to specific performance (absent a defense). Land is inherently unique an damages cannot be an adequate remedy.
  - See *[Kitchen v. Herring](link)*
- Sale of Goods/Chattels
  - Distinction between land and goods, specific performance contracts over goods in certain conditions
    - Timing, Quality, Quantity
    - Reputation Damages
      - See *[Curtice Brothers Co. v. Catts](link)*
    -
- Damages at law & Jurisdiction of Specific Performance Depends on grounds that damages will not afford a complete remedy.
- The remedy for a breach of contract for the sale of personal property is an action at law, where  damages  are  awarded.  However,  there  are  recognized  exceptions.  Jurisdiction  to enforce  specific  performance  rests,  not  on  the  distinction  between  real  and  personal property, but on the ground that damages at law will not afford a complete remedy.
  - See *[Curran v. Barefoot](link)*


#### UCC 2-716 Buyers Right to Specific Performance or Replevin
- 1. Specific Performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances
- 2. The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just.

#### Unique Goods
- Uniquness is not the sole basis of the remedy under UCC 2-716
  - Relief may also be granted in other proper circumstances.
  - Scarcity of good/chattel considered whether specific performance will be granted.
- Courts determine whether good is replaceable as a practical matter
  - Difficulty obtaining good on open market.

#### Defenses to Specific Performance
- Courts will not grant Specific Performance for personal services
  - Performance of K may be less than a complete performance
  - Equivilant to indentured servitude
  - Surveillance and oversight of Court
- Employee-Employer context, specific performance generally precluded to either party
  - See *[Pratt Furniture Co. v. McBee](link)*

## The Universal Commercial Code
  - UCC tries to make promisee whole + incurred costs “for goods”
  - Article 1 - Remedies to be liberally Administered
    - Compensatory Damages + Search Costs
  - Article 2 of the UCC
    - Applies to “Transactions in goods”
    - “Goods” includes “all things” which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale

---

## Nominal
  - Small amount of award where the ∆ is in breach but the π has suffered no quantifiable loss.
    - Legal record of who is at fault

---





---

## Case Headnotes
- Groves v. John Wunder Co.
  - In reckoning damages for breach of a building or construction contract, the law aims to give the disappointed promisee, so far as money will do it, what he was promised.
  - Even in case of substantial performance in good faith, the resulting defects being remediable, it is error to instruct that the measure of damage is the difference in value between the house as it was and as it would have been if constructed according to contract. The correct doctrine is that the cost of remedying the defect is the proper measure of damages

## Problems

#### 3-2 page 284
- π = Edgar Janis (Non breaching party)
- ∆ = Addis Corp. (Breaching Party)
- K = 1 Year Employment Contract - $1500/month
  - Market Value of Services was $1200 per month
- Facts: Worked 1 month, and then terminated
  - Diligent Search for 10 months until he took a comparable job for comparable pay
- Rule: When a employer wrongfully terminates an employee, π is entitled to any unpaid salary up to the time of the breach and the salary for the remaining term.
- Damages = Lost Expectancy
  - At the time of breach π had been paid for 1 month.
  - Final month of year π had a job of comparable status & salary
  - **π damages = K price - π earnings ** + (reasonable search costs)
    - π must try to minimize damages.
    - Deduct from recovery any salary she makes or could have made by accepting a reasonable substitute for employment.

#### 3-3
- π Norgaard (NonBreaching Party)
- ∆ Anderson (Breaching Party)
- K = Realestate Contract: Morning of May 7th, buy a farm for $125,000 on July 15th.
- Facts:
  - Evening of May 7th, ∆ changed his minde and gave notice to π.
  - Fair market value of house is $122,000
  - π tried without sucess to resell to others for $125,000
- Remedies Formula: **Damages = Contract Price for House - Market Value of House**
- Rule: Under Section 708 π can recover the contract price market differential if π resells the farm in good faith.
  - Market Fluctuations for a property will be upheld
    - Policy notions regarding contract's validity
    - Court take a hardline on "backing out of deals"

“The “cover” price is the price of the substitute purchase.) If the substitute purchase is “in good faith,” is “without unreasonable delay,” and is otherwise reasonable”
“section 2–712(1) says the buyer “may” cover, suggesting that the section is optional and that Alice can recover under section 2–713”
- Formula = Contract Price - Market Price
