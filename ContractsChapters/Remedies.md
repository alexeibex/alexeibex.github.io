## Measure of Damages when Breach

## Measure of Expectations Damages
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in **if the contract had performed**.
    - You get what you bargained for.
  - Expectation Damages are the difference between **promised performance and actual performance**
    - Breach of Contract to Perform Services
      - Two remedies
        - **Cost of Completion**
          - If a contracter leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover **cost of completion**.

    - Breach of Contract for the Sale of Goods
      - UCC Governs
        - Seller's Breach
          - Specfic Relief & Damages
    - [*Hawkins v. McGee*](LINK)
  - Objective v. Subjective Reward of Expectation Damages
    - [Groves v. John Wunder Co.](Link)
    - Diminuation in Value
      - Where cost of performance exceeds diminuation in value, courts are likely to award damages only for diminuation in value.

## Reliance
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract **had not been made.**
  - Reliance Damages
    - Appropriate measure of damages is the difference between:
      - (Performance of the contract as promised) - (the Actual Performance) = Cost Incurred
    - When there are no **measureable lost profits** reliance may be the only way to avoid injustice.

## Restitution
  - Restores to the promisee any benefit he conferred to the promisor.
  - The non-breaching party will sometimes be satisfied with rescission of the contract and restitution of any value conferred on the breaching party. The purpose of restitution is to prevent unjust enrichment.
  - Restitution damages are based on benefit incurred.
  - [**Unjust enrichment**](Link): measured by the benefit the plaintiff conferred on the defendant.
  - [Quantum meruit](Link): measured by the value of the plaintiff’s services. The plaintiff can recover even if performance of the contract would have resulted in a loss.
  - Restitution vs. Quantum meruit
    - Example: Bank Error in your favor
      - Under Restitution: You must give the money back. Otherwise, Unjust enrichment
      - Quantum meruit: The bank can recover nothing because it did not render any service of value.
  - Modern Trend to allow breaching party to recover for benefit conferred (minus actual injury)
    - “ . . . the breaching party is entitled to the reasonable value of its services less any damages caused by the breach.”
    - " . . . a party injured by breach of contract is entitled to retain nothing in excess of that sum which compensates him for the loss of his bargain.”

## The Universal Commercial Code
  - UCC tries to make promisee whole + incurred costs “for goods”
  - Article 1 - Remedies to be liberally Administered
    - Compensatory Damages + Search Costs
  - Article 2 of the UCC
    - Applies to “Transactions in goods”
    - “Goods” includes “all things” which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale

## Nominal
  - Small amount of award where the ∆ is in breach but the π has suffered no quantifiable loss.
    - Legal record of who is at fault

--- ## Case Headnotes
- Groves v. John Wunder Co.
  - In reckoning damages for breach of a building or construction contract, the law aims to give the disappointed promisee, so far as money will do it, what he was promised.
  - Even in case of substantial performance in good faith, the resulting defects being remediable, it is error to instruct that the measure of damage is the difference in value between the house as it was and as it would have been if constructed according to contract. The correct doctrine is that the cost of remedying the defect is the proper measure of damages
