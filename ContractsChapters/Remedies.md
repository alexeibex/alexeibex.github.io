  - No punitive damages recognized

## Measure of Damages when Breach

## Measure of Expectations Damages
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in **if the contract had performed**.
    - You get what you bargained for.
  - Compensatory Damages
    - Monetary Damages
    - Courts will generally not order specific performance when money damages are adequate
  - Expectation Damages are the difference between **promised performance and actual performance**
    - Breach of Contract to Perform Services


      - Two remedies
        - **Cost of Completion**
          - If a contracter leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover **cost of completion**.
    - Breach of Contract for the Sale of Goods
      - UCC Governs
        - Seller's Breach
          - Specfic Relief & Damages

### Objective v. Subjective Reward of Expectation Damages
- **Cost-to-Complete**
  - Cost-of-completion damages will sometimes put the owner in a better economic position than he would have been in if the contract had been fully performed. The factfinder should determine whether the owner is likely to pocket the difference or actually put it towards repairs.
  - If a contractor leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover cost of completion damages.
    - [Groves v. John Wunder Co.](Link)
  - Environmental Statutes
    - [Rock Island Improvement Company v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.](Link)
  - Intent of π to use funds won to complete said contract
    - Begins to look like specific performance
    - [Radford v. De Froberville](Link)


- **Diminuation in Value**
  - Where cost of performance exceeds diminuation (grossly dispraportionate) in value, courts are likely to award damages only for diminuation in value. (subjective value)
  - "The cost of remedying the defects is grossly proportionate to the benefits . . .”
  - The court affirmed Peevyhouse, despite recent statutory revisions. “ . . . where the cost is grossly disproportionate to the cost of reclamation as in Peevyhouse, a review of recent case law suggests that courts are adhering to the diminution in value award"
    - [Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining Co.](Link)
  - Diminished value damages should be measured at the date of the breach, not the original date of the contract.
- **Cost-of-completion and diminished-value** damages are not the only possibilities.
  - The measure should be “the loss truly suffered by the promisee.”
- **Factors to Consider and Influence Damages**
  - Asthetics + Good-Faith
    - When the damages are aesthetically important, and when the builder does not act in good faith, the diminution in value rule does not apply. Rather, the owner can recover the full cost of repair.
  - Waste
    - Paying the full cost of restoration would be “a useless and wasteful expenditure of funds . .
  - Residential v. Commercial
    - . . . a distinction exists between a contract to construct a dwelling for the owner who plans to live therein and a contract to construct a commercial structure where the aesthetic taste of the owner is not so deeply involved.
  - Pleasure and Amenity
    - Cost-of-completion and diminished-value damages are not the only possibilities. The measure should be “the loss truly suffered by the promisee.”


### Formulas for Measuring Damages
- There are two formulae for calculating a contractor’s damages from the owner’s breach:
 - (a) Contractor’s expenses + contractor’s lost profits - amount paid by owner prior to breach. Aiello.
 - Contract price - cost of completion that the contractor saved - amount paid by owner prior to breach.
   - (Restatement Second § 346.)
 - The two are algebraically equivalent, but courts usually use the second.
- Owner’s damages for builder’s breach
  -Reasonable Cover - Contract Price
    - [Thorne v. White](Link)
  - The amount the builder owes the owner = (total cost of completion) - (total original contract price - amount the owner already paid builder).
    - [Morello v. J.H. Hogan, Inc.](Link)
- Profit Damages
  - Contract price - cost of completion that the contractor saved - amount paid by owner prior to breach.
    - Restatement Second § 346.
  - Profit rewarded because of implied in the reliance of party on the contract


#### Examination of actual benefit for determining Damages
  - Measure of Damages != Cost of performance v. Extent of harm by non-performance
    - [Freund v. Washington Square Press]
      - Cost to publish books v. Injury to the party was loss of royalties
        - Revise contract "I want the books published" v. "I want the royalties of the books sold that are published"


### Restatement Second § 347: Measure of Damages in General
- A contracts to build a house for B for $100,000. B breaches halfway through. A would have to spend $60,000 to finish. A’s damages are the contract price ($100,000) - cost of completion that the contractor saved ($60,000) = $40,000. A can recover $40,000 minus any payments already made.

## Reliance
  - Puts promisee in the position he would have been in if the contract **had not been made.**
  - Reliance Damages
    - Appropriate measure of damages is the difference between:
      - (Performance of the contract as promised) - (the Actual Performance) = Cost Incurred
    - When there are no **measureable lost profits** reliance may be the only way to avoid injustice.
  - [Sullivan v. O'Connor](https://alexeibex.github.io/Contracts#case-sullivan-v-oconnor)
---

## Restitution
  - Restores to the promisee any benefit he conferred to the promisor.
  - The non-breaching party will sometimes be satisfied with rescission of the contract and restitution of any value conferred on the breaching party. The purpose of restitution is to prevent unjust enrichment.
  - Restitution damages are based on benefit incurred.
  - [**Unjust enrichment**](Link): measured by the benefit the plaintiff conferred on the defendant.
  - [Quantum meruit](Link): measured by the value of the plaintiff’s services. The plaintiff can recover even if performance of the contract would have resulted in a loss.
  - Restitution vs. Quantum meruit
    - Example: Bank Error in your favor
      - Under Restitution: You must give the money back. Otherwise, Unjust enrichment
      - Quantum meruit: The bank can recover nothing because it did not render any service of value.
  - Modern Trend to allow breaching party to recover for benefit conferred (minus actual injury)
    - “ . . . the breaching party is entitled to the reasonable value of its services less any damages caused by the breach.”
    - " . . . a party injured by breach of contract is entitled to retain nothing in excess of that sum which compensates him for the loss of his bargain.”

## The Universal Commercial Code
  - UCC tries to make promisee whole + incurred costs “for goods”
  - Article 1 - Remedies to be liberally Administered
    - Compensatory Damages + Search Costs
  - Article 2 of the UCC
    - Applies to “Transactions in goods”
    - “Goods” includes “all things” which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale

## Nominal
  - Small amount of award where the ∆ is in breach but the π has suffered no quantifiable loss.
    - Legal record of who is at fault

--- ## Case Headnotes
- Groves v. John Wunder Co.
  - In reckoning damages for breach of a building or construction contract, the law aims to give the disappointed promisee, so far as money will do it, what he was promised.
  - Even in case of substantial performance in good faith, the resulting defects being remediable, it is error to instruct that the measure of damage is the difference in value between the house as it was and as it would have been if constructed according to contract. The correct doctrine is that the cost of remedying the defect is the proper measure of damages
