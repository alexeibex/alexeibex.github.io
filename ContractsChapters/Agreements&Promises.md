## Agreements & Promises
- **Agreement in a manifestation of mututal assent on the part of two or more parties.**

- Contract = **Agreement** + [Consideration](link)

### The Nature of Assent: Subjectivity v. Objectivity
- Agreements = Offer + Meeting of the Minds + Acceptance
#### The Objective Nature of Assent

- Intention of Agreements
  - Contracts generally require a meeting of the minds, **but** intent is irrelevant if the other party could not reasonably know the other’s intent.
    - Inner intention of parties cannot make or deny a contract if what **was said was enough**
  - Objective Standard: **Manifestation of Assent**
    - Courts consider: conduct, acts, express declarations;
    - **What a reasonable person would think was being agreed to** and reasonable meaning of conduct/words.
  - Objective Standard: Protects the reliance of parties that reasonably rely on conduct/words.
    - See *[Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co.](link)*

- Objective Intent
  - Generally Contract Law Enforces the apparent, not necessiarily real intention of the promisor
  - Manifestation of Intent: Must look to the outward expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention.
    - Conduct gave rise to a reasonable interpretation that there was no intent to sell.
    - Even with very little reliance, Contract was considered valid
      - Whittier: To hold one for the merely careless use of language which causes no damage whatever to the party to whom the language is addressed is certainly inconsistent with principles generally applied.
      - Must look to the outward expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention.
      - Belief on the promise must also be **reasonable** & **honest**
        - See *[Lucy v. Zehmer](link)*


- Agreement between Family Members
  - Presumption that family members may not make their arrangements contractual in nature.
    - But in such cases the party asserting the contract has the burden of setting aside our belief that most such arrangements are not contractual.
      - See *[Morrow v. Morrow](link)*

- Contract despite Objective Intent
  - Promise inducing performance = K when expecting something from party
    - See *[Tilbert v. Eagle Lock Co.](link)*

- Mistake in Contract & Misunderstanding
  - Reasonable and Objective Standard
  - See *[Cargill Commission Co. v. Mowery](link)*

- Interpretation of Contract
  - Restatement (Second) of Contracts §20 Effects of Misunderstanding
    - There is no manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange if the parties attach materially different meanings to their manifestations and
      - **neither party knows or has reason to know the meaning attached by the other; or
      - each party knows or each party has reason to know the meaning attached by the other.
    - The manifestations of the parties are operative in accordance with the meaning attached to them by one of the parties if
      - that party does not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knows the meaning attached by the first party; or
      - that party has no reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other has reason to know the meaning attached by the first party;
  - Restatement § 201
    - The issue is, what is chicken?”
      - If both parties are found to have each acted in good faith and that neither had a reason to know of the difference in meaning, both claims fail.
  - When both parties to a contract are mistaken as to an essential element of the contract, the Court will attempt to find a reasonable interpretation from the context of the agreement before it will void it.
    - Latent ambiguity resulted in "no contract" since both parties intended two speparate things.
      - Subjective interpration within the K (two reasonable interpretations of "Peerless") v. an Objective term (35,000 bushels when you mean 3,500)
      - Mutual Misunderstanding = No Meeting of the Minds = No K
        - See *[Raffles v. Wichelhaus](link)*
- Mismatch of Parties understanding
  - Attempting to encourage communication
    - See *[Dickey v. Hurd](Link)*


### The Offer
- General approach is to look for 1 form of communication that = offer and another that = an acceptance
- **Offer** + **Acceptance** = **Agreement**
#### Corbin on Contracts
  - Offer is an expression by one party of assent to certain definite terms, provided that the other party involved in the bargaining transaction will likewise express assent to the same terms.
    - Contract law must determine whether a reasonable person, acquainted with all the circumstances, would believe that the author of the communication alleged to be an offer intended to be bound upon assent(acceptance) by the other party.
  - Note: Offer = "Expression" of assent does not have to be an actual assent

#### Unilateral Offers
- **Where the offer is clear, definite, and explicit, and leaves nothing open for negotiation, it constitutes an offer, acceptance of which will complete the contract.**
- Store intended to be held to the offer
  - Objective theory of legitimate offer? Examine Circumstances
    - Attmpting to draw women into the store to shop
    - One ad was considered too "speculative"
  - See *[Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, Inc.](link)*


#### Limits on Unilateral Offers
- Generally ads are generally not considered unilateral contracts because advertiser does not seek to be bound by any reader but instead is merely inviting reader to come negotiate.
- Advertisements are generally invitations. Targeted to mass of individuals. Generally stores do not have enough product for "everyone"
- Considered invitations to protect merchants
  - See *[Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Russell](link)*
    - A reasonable person would understand that not every person qualifies for financing.
    - A reasonable person also knows there are not an unlimted amount of cars being sold

### The Acceptance
#### Preliminary Negotiations
- General Approach is to look for a particular communication that constitutes an offer and another communication that constitues an acceptance.
  - Question:
    - "Wire firm offer?" - Court still rules no acceptance
    - Ambiguity in corespondence, Court tips the scale on scales
      - See *[Courteen Seed Co. v. Abraham](link)*

#### Uniform Commercial Code §2-204(3)
- Even if one or more terms are left open a cotnract for sale does not fail the indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.


#### Corbin Offer and Acceptance
  - An acceptance is a voluntary act of the offeree whereby he exercises the power conferred upon him by the offer and thereby creates the set of legal relations called a contract.

##### Unrealistic Offers
- See *[Leondard v. Pepsico Inc.](link)*
  - Advertisement showing 7 million Pepsi points for a Harrier Jet
    - Unreasonable to believe that Harrier jet was a real offer.
      - Ad did not amount to an offer of goods
      - No objective person could reasonably have concluded that the commercial actually offered consumers a Harrier Jet
      - The alleged contract could not satisfy the New York Statute of Frauds
  - 93 Rock Tattoo on Forehead


### Acceptance of an Offer
- Acceptance of an offer is a **manifestation** of assent to terms thereof made by the offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer.

- Uniform Commercial Code §2-206(1)(a)
  - Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances
    - **an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any *manner and by any medium* reasonable in the circumstances**
- Restatement (Second of Contracts) §32 - Invitation of Promsie or Performance
  - In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.
  - See *[Bergey v. HSBC Bank USA](link)*

#### Qualified Acceptance & Manifestations of Acceptance
- Conditions on an agreement are considered qualified agreements and are not agreements at all.
- Offer is a **manifestation** of an intent to enter into a legal agreement.
- “We must be concerned only with the language actually used, not the language the offeree thought he was using or intended to use.”
- Mirror Image Rule - **Acceptance must mirror the offer that was made otherwise becomes a new offer.**
  - Exception: Counter Inquiry - Acceptance may be valid despite conditional language if the acceptance is clearly indpendent of the condition.
  - Qualified acceptance is no acceptance at all
    - See *[Ardente v Horan](Link)*

#### Acceptance by Performance & Acceptance by Silence

- Partial Performance
  - Not a unilateral contract case because partial performance can be acceptance but
    - Acceptance must be clearly communicated to the offeror
    - "Upon" objectively indicates a bilateral contract
    - An act by itself is no indication of an acceptance, does not become acceptance even if motivated by the requisite intent.
      - Here buying the lumber would have been done anyway, not an overt act of acceptance
  - See *[White v. Corlies](link)*


- Performance Option
  - Unleess an offer communicates different terms of acceptance, an offeree who begins performance has an option to complete performance according to the terms of the contract. (N/A in White v. Corlies)
    - Everyone must know acceptance has occurred.


- General Rule of No acceptance by Silence
  - See *[Ducommun v. Johnson](link)*
- Exception to the Silence rule and constitutes acceptance when one has reason to know other party expects payment/performance and silent party takes the benefit of the service with a reasonable opportunity to stop the performing party.
  - Restatement 69(2)
    - Offeree is bound to an offer when she does not act inconsistent with the offeror's ownership of offered property.
    - Federal Law now declares the mailing of goods to be an unfair trade practice and is equivilent to a gift.
      - UCC 39 - Mailing of Unordered Merchandise

- Restatement §69 Acceptance by silence or exercise of dominion
  - Where an offeree fails to reply to an offer, his silence and inaction operates as an acceptance in the following cases only:
    - Where an offeree takes the benefit of offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation
    - Where the oferor has stated or given the offeree reason to understand that assent may be manifested by silence or inaction and the offeree in remaining silent and inactive intends to accept the offer
    - Where because of previous dealings or otherwise it is reasonable that the offeree should notify the oferor if he does not intend to accept.
    - An offeree who does any act inconsistent with the offeror's ownership of offered property is bound in accordance with the offered terms unless they are manifestly unreasonable. But if the act is wrongful as against the offeror it is an acceptance only if ratifed by him.



#### Problem 4-11
- Under Restatement §69
  - If it is easy to decline the offer, courts will likely say that offeree has to send it back because law imposes a duty
- Under UCC 39 - Prevention of Impositions and Responsibilites on average persons, discentivize SPAMMING
  - Happy Birthday Provision
    - He may treat the merchandise as a gift to him and has right to retain, use, discard, or dispose of it in any manner he sees fit without any obligation whatsover to the sender
  - What if UPS/FEDEX (not mail)


#### Offeror's Power to Prescribe Terms of Offer
- Offeror can set any price and terms which the offeree must accept in order for there to be a contract
  - Offeree can always reject and counter the offer
- Offeror can also prescribe terms concerning the manner of acceptance of an offer.
  - Prescriptions = Terms offeree must follow to form a K
  - Suggestions = Terms in the offer that offeree does not have to comply with to accept.

#### Offers for Unilateral and Bilateral Contracts
- Offers can prescribe either a return promise as an acceptance or a return performance as an acceptance.
  - See *[Davis v. Jacoby](link)

#### Duration of Offers
- Restatement §36 Methods of Termination of the Power of Acceptance
  - An offeree's power of acceptance may be terminated by:
    - rejection or counter-offer by the offeree, or
    - lapse of time, or
    - lapse of time, or
    - revocation by the offeror, or
    - death or incapacity of the offeror/offeree
  - In addition an offeree's power of acceptance is terminated by the non-occurrence of any condition of acceptance under the terms of the offer.
- An offer is rejected when the offeror is justified in inferring from the words or conduct of the offeree that the offeree intends not to accept the offer.
  - When a reasonable person would believe the offeree does not accept the offer, contract law treats the offeree's decision as a rejection of the offer.
  - When an offer is rejected, it ceases to exist, and a subsequent attempted acceptance is inoperative to bind the offeror
- Lapse of Time = "reasonable time"
  - If the offeror specifies the time an offer remains open, the offeree must accept by the deadline
  - Examined by taking in all the circumstances and determining what a "reasonable person" would infer as the deadline
    - Offers during Personal Conversations end at end of conversation.
    - An Offer is rejected when the offeror is justified in inferring from words or conduct of the offeree that the offeree intends not to accept the offer.
      - See *[Akers v. J.B. Sedberry, Inc.](link)*
- Farnsworth on Rejection
  - General proposition that once an offer is rejected, offeree cannot go back and accept because the offeror may have relied on the rejection by action or inaction or by merely failing to revoke the offer.
- Specified Durations
  - When does the time frame/limit begin?
  - Where a person uses the post to make an offer, the offer is not made when it is posted, but when it is received.
    - Contracting parties are present, words spoken by one party must *strike the ear of the other* before there can be *mutual assent*
      - A concurrence of the minds (knowledge of the offer) required otherwise there is no consideration between parties.
      - See *[Caldwell v. Cline](links)*

#### Counter Offers
- Restatement §39(2)
  - An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated by his making of a counter-offer unless the offeror has manifested a contrary intention or unless the counter offer manifests a contrary intention of the offeree.
  - A manifestation of intention not to accept an offer is a rejection **unless the oferee manifests an intention to take it under further advisement**
    - See *[Collins v. Thompson](link)*

#### Revoking an Offer
  - Revocation occurs when a reasonable person would believe the offeror has withdrawn the offer.
- Restatement §42:
  - An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated when the offeree receives from the offeror a manifestation of an intention not to enter into the proposed contract.
  - Can also be information that makes clear the offer has been withdrawn (Receiving information that the good is already sold)
  - Revocation must be **received** before the offeree's power of acceptance is terminated
    - Promise to keep an offer open is a gift promise
      - The ordinary offer is revocable even though it expressly states the contrary, because the doctrine that an informal agreement is binding as a bargain only if supported by **consideration**
      - See *[Dickinson v. Dodds](link)*

#### Bars to Recovation - Option Contracts
- An offer accompanied by some form of consideration, may protect an offeree, by entitling the offeree to treat the offer as irrevocable within specific time constraints.
- Restatement §82:
  - An offer is binding as an option contract if:
    - Is in writing and signed by the offeror, **recites** a purported consideration for the making of the offer, and proposes an exchange on fair terms within a reasonable time; or
    - is made irrevocable by statute
- *Consideration and form*
  - Traditional Common-law device for making a firm offer or option contract are the giving of consideration and the affixing of a seal.
  - Nominal Consideration: Offers made in consideration of one dollar paid or promised are often irrevocable...
    - BUT gross disproportion between the payment and the value of the option commonly indicates that the payment was not in fact bargained for but was a mere formality or pretense. In such case there is no consideration.
    - A payment of one dollar by each party to the other is so obviously not a bargaining transaction that it does not provide even the form of an exchange.
- Courts interpret the Restatement as a formality and consideration can be nominal and recited not actually recieved.
  - See *[Marsh v. Lott]

- UCC 2-205 - Firm Offers
  - An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months...
    - No consideration required for UCC



#### Bars to Revocation - Partial Performance
- Restatement §45: “Where an offer invites an offeree to accept by rendering a performance and does not invite a promissory acceptance, an option contract is created when the offeree **tenders or begins the invited performance or tenders a beginning of it**”
- Which way does the equity cut?
  - In a unilateral contract offeree once they begin performance must be given the change to complete the option contract.
  - In general, offeror can revoke prior to "acceptance"
  - “Contract law protects an offeree who relies on an offer when the only way to accept requires the offeree to begin performance.”
    - See *[Brackenbury v. Hodgkin](link)*
- When does performance begin?
  - Unilateral K On Steroids
    - See *[Petterson v. Pattberg]


#### Unilateral & Bilateral Promises
- Unilateral Contract - A promise in exchange for an act
- Bilateral Contract - A promise in exchange for a promise
- “The offeree can accept only by following the offeror’s prescription. ”
  - See *[Davis v. Jacoby](link)
    - If Unilateral Promise - π would lose since death would have terminated ability for acceptance
    - If Bilateral Promise - π would win because performance would have begun as soon as promise was given from both parties.
    - Critique: Love and Affection of familial relationship?

#### Duty of the Offeree of aa Unilateral Contract - Notice to the Offeror
- The offeror expects or requires notice of acceptance apart from notice of the performance
  - See *[Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke](link)*
- Restatement §54
  - (1) Contract is formed by performance without any notice **unless** the offer requests a notice.
  - (2) The offeror is discharged if the offeree has reason to know that the offeror has no adequate means of learning of the performance promptly, unless the oferee "exercises reasonable diligence" to notify the offeror, or the offeror learns of the performance within a reasonable time" or the offeror indicates that notification of acceptance is not required.
- UCC 2-206(2)
  - Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonble mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonble time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.
- See *[Drennan v. Star Paving Co.](link)*
  - No Bargain for exchange
  - No Option with no consideration
  - Bilateral K Promise
    - Reasonable reliance resulting in a foreseeable prejudicial change in position affords a compelling basis also for implying a subsidiary promise not to revoke an offer for a bilateral contract = to part performance = consideration
      - Absence of Consideration not a factor.
        - If offeree knew or had reason to believe that offeror‘s bid was in error, he could not justifiably rely on it and it is unenforceable
        - Mistakes fall on party **that cause them**
  - Critique: Subcontractors are bound to the general, but the general is not bound to the subcontractor, creating incentives for the general contractor to act unethically:
    - Bid shopping: using the lowest bid to negotiate lower bids from oth- ers.
    - Bid chopping: pressuring the subcontractor to make a lower bid.
    - Bid peddling: a subcontractor waits until other bids are in and then undercutting them, avoiding the cost of estimating his own bid.

- Restatement §87(2)
  - An offer which the offeror should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character on the part of the offeree before acceptance and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding as an option contract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.
  - An option contract is an offer in which the offeror promises to keep the offer open for a certain period of time. For instance, a seller grants a buyer the option to buy his house for $1,000 anytime during the next month.
  - The distinction between §§ 45 and 87 is that an offeree who has begun performance can recover expectation damages, while an offeree who has not begun performance can only recover reliance damages.
- Reliance in the Bargaining Context
  - See *[Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores, Inc](link)*




### Bargaining at a Distance (Mail)
- MailBox Rule
  - Traditional Acceptance Rule - The contract has been deemed to be completed as soon as the letter of acceptance has been put into the post-office duly addressed
  - Protects the Offeree over the offeror
    - See *[Adams v Lindsell](link)*
      - Offeree cannot revoke acceptance after mailing but before receipt either (this would be unfair and allow speculation by offeree)
      - Offeree cannot revoke acceptance by intercepting the acceptance before receipt (but, practically, offeror cannot enforce acceptance he doesn‘t know about)

- Restatment §40
  - Whichever notice is given first to offeror takes precedent in the event of 2 contradictory notices.


- “The offeror can always expressly condition the contract on his receipt of an acceptance and, should he fail to do so, the law should not afford him this advantage”
  - See *[Morrison v. Thoelke](link)*

- Electronic Contract Issues
- Contract Formation Revisited
  - Generally subjects believed formation happened when parties signed documents or paid for the goods, not when they communicated assent verbally
  - No Coherent rules on electronic transactions
    - Utilization of paper rules where applicable

### Agreements to Agree and Related Matters
- Preliminary negotiations that eventually lead to a final contract
  - If parties agree to everything prior to contract formation have they in effect already created a contract
    - Written K acts as a written formality/memorium on contract.
- The entire document and relevant circumstances surrounding its adoption must be considered in making a determination of the parties’ intention.
  - Relevant Circumstances include:
    - Any Preparation
  - See *[Arnold Palmer Golf Co. v. Fuqua Indus., Inc.](link)*
- Restatement §27 - Existance of Contract Where Written Memorial is Contemplated
  - Factors for determining the formation of a contract include:
    - the extent to which express agreement has been reached on all the terms to be included,
    - whether the contract is the type usually put in writing,
    - whether it needs a formal writing for its full expression,
    - whether it has few or many details,
    - whether the amount involved is large or small,...
    - and whether either party takes any action in preparation for performance during the negotiations

#### Letters of Intent
- Where parties make a pact subject to a later, definitive agreement, they have manifested an objective intent not to be bound: Where no ambiguity exists in the language, intent will be determined solely from that language
  - See *[Empro Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Ball-Co Manufacturing, Inc.](Link)*

#### Requirement of Certainty in Business
- It is rightfully well settled that a mere **agreement to agree**, in which a material term is left for future negotiations, is **unenforceable**
- See *[Joseph Martin, Jr. Delicatessen, Inc. v. Schumacher](Link)*
  - Dissent: Reasonable rent should be used in liue of material terms left for future negotiations.
- UCC 2-204(3)
  - Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.


### Limits on the Scope of Traditional Offer-Acceptance Analysis Summary
- Traditional Contract Law v. Practical Contract Law and What Actually Happens
  - No Sequence of Offer and Acceptance but instead Sequence of Successive Drafts with a "formal" closing
#### Manifestation of Assent Without Identifiable Sequence in Offer and Acceptance
- No doubt in American Law that a contract can be formed without an identifiable sequence of offer and acceptance
- Manifestation of Assent exchanged simultaneously
- Long negotiations making identification of offer and acceptance impossible
- Assent manifested gradually


### Contract Formation in the Form of Contract Setting
- UCC 2-204(2)
  - An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.

- UCC 2-207 - Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation
  - Mitigation of the Mirror Image Rule
- Difference of Terms
  - Standard Terms (Boiler Plate)
  - Negotiated Terms (Quantity, Price, Time)

- Common Law Last Shot Principle
  - Party that sent the last form constitute Counter-Offer
  - Performance by receiving party = Acceptance of Counter-Offer
  - Last Party to Send Terms = Applicable Terms
- Practical Issues
  - Parties do not read the terms during purchase and contract agreements

- Terms 2-207(2)
  - 3 Approaches to Terms Different v. Additional Terms
    - **Majority Knockout Method**: Conflicting Terms knock each other out and both get removed and replaced with Code.
    - Official Comment: Different Terms = Additional Terms
    - Fallout Approach: Conflicting Terms balance in favor to Offeror and offeree's conflicting term drops out.


- Routes of Contract Formation under 2-207
  - Distinct Routes
    - **Route A**: Closing a contract via a "definite and seasonable expression of acceptance"
      - Abrogation of the mirror image rule
      - Inclusion of Additinal Terms but not Different Terms
        - Difference between stems from prior terms enumerated (different) or not enumereated (additional)
      - Sections a-c apply only to **Merchants** - Who Deal in Goods of the kind..
      - Terms: 207(2)
    - Route A1
      - " A written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those agreed upon."
      - Terms: 207(2)
    - **Route B**: Subsection 1 After the Comma. (My Way or the Highway)
      - Unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms (Counter Offer)
        - Performance = Acceptance of a counter offer.
        - Similar to Common Law Finding of Contract Formation
      - Terms:
    - **Route C**: When parties forms hopelessly conflict and do not have the intention to be bound yet parties act as if they have a contract such as by delivery or payment of goods.
      - Terms: If Applicable, specifies the terms to use in Contract.
        - Matching terms in each form and to fill remaining gaps, with terms supplied in other provisions of article 2
  - See *[Stemcor USA, Inc. v. Trident Steel Corp](link)*
    - Route B Application
      -
Trident Purchase Order  | Stemcor Acknowledgement
--|---|
No Arbitration Term  | Arbitration Term

#### Examination of Terms under 2-207
- Lawsuit over an arbitration cause
  - π Analysis under 2-207
    - Subsection 2 - Between Merchant and Consumer
      - Mere proposal
- Easterbrook Decision
  - Contract was formed when opportunity to read terms were given in the box - Rolling Contract
  - Rolling Contract = Pay Now, Terms Later
    - “Money now, terms later”: shrinkwrap agreements, in which a buyer purchases software and must agree to additional license terms before using it, are valid. The rule applies to both software and hardware.
      - See *[Hill v. Gateway 2000](link)*
- Distinguished by StepSaver
  - Court uses 2-207(2)(b) and rejects Easterbrook approach
    - Material Alteration of Terms
- See *[Step-Saver Data Sys. v. Wyse Tech., Inc](link)*
