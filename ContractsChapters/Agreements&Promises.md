- Contract = **Agreement** + [Consideration](link)

### The Nature of Assent: Subjectivity v. Objectivity
#### The Objective Nature of Assent

- Intention of Agreements
  - Contracts generally require a meeting of the minds, **but** intent is irrelevant if the other party could not reasonably know the otherâ€™s intent.
    - Inner intention of parties cannot make or deny a contract if what **was said was enough**
  - Objective Standard: **Manifestation of Assent**
    - Courts consider: conduct, acts, express declarations;
    - **What a reasonable person would think was being agreed to** and reasonable meaning of conduct/words.
  - Objective Standard: Protects the reliance of parties that reasonably rely on conduct/words.
    - See *[Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co.](link)*



- Objective Intent
  - Manifestation of Intent: Must look to the outward expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention.
    - Conduct gave rise to a reasonable interpretation that there was no intent to sell.
    - Even with very little reliance, Contract was considered valid
      - Whittier: To hold one for the merely careless use of language which causes no damage whatever to the party to whom the language is addressed is certainly inconsistent with principles generally applied.
      - See *[Lucy v. Zehmer](link)*


- Agreement between Family Members
  - Presumption that family members may not make their arrangements contractual in nature.
    - But in such cases the party asserting the contract has the burden of setting aside our belief that most such arrangements are not contractual.
      - See *[Morrow v. Morrow](link)*

- Contract despite Objective Intent
  - Promise inducing performance = K when expecting something from party
    - See *[Tilbert v. Eagle Lock Co.](link)*
