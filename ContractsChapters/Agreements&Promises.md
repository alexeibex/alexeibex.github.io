## Agreements & Promises

- Contract = **Agreement** + [Consideration](link)

### The Nature of Assent: Subjectivity v. Objectivity
#### The Objective Nature of Assent

- Intention of Agreements
  - Contracts generally require a meeting of the minds, **but** intent is irrelevant if the other party could not reasonably know the other’s intent.
    - Inner intention of parties cannot make or deny a contract if what **was said was enough**
  - Objective Standard: **Manifestation of Assent**
    - Courts consider: conduct, acts, express declarations;
    - **What a reasonable person would think was being agreed to** and reasonable meaning of conduct/words.
  - Objective Standard: Protects the reliance of parties that reasonably rely on conduct/words.
    - See *[Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co.](link)*



- Objective Intent
  - Manifestation of Intent: Must look to the outward expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention.
    - Conduct gave rise to a reasonable interpretation that there was no intent to sell.
    - Even with very little reliance, Contract was considered valid
      - Whittier: To hold one for the merely careless use of language which causes no damage whatever to the party to whom the language is addressed is certainly inconsistent with principles generally applied.
      - See *[Lucy v. Zehmer](link)*


- Agreement between Family Members
  - Presumption that family members may not make their arrangements contractual in nature.
    - But in such cases the party asserting the contract has the burden of setting aside our belief that most such arrangements are not contractual.
      - See *[Morrow v. Morrow](link)*

- Contract despite Objective Intent
  - Promise inducing performance = K when expecting something from party
    - See *[Tilbert v. Eagle Lock Co.](link)*

- Mistake in Contract
  - See *[Cargill Commission Co. v. Mowery](link)*

- Interpretation
  - Restatement (Second) of Contracts §20 Effects of Misunderstanding
    - There is no manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange if the parties attach materially different meanings to their manifestations and
      - **neither party knows or has reason to know the meaning attached by the other; or
      - each party knows or each party has reason to know the meaning attached by the other.
    - The manifestations of the parties are operative in accordance with the meaning attached to them by one of the parties if
      - that party does not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knows the meaning attached by the first party; or
      - that party has no reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other has reason to know the meaning attached by the first party;
  - Restatement § 201
    - The issue is, what is chicken?”
      - If both parties are found to have each acted in good faith and that neitehr had areason to know of the difference in meaning, both claims fail.
  - When both parties to a contract are mistaken as to an essential element of the contract, the Court will attempt to find a reasonable interpretation from the context of the agreement before it will void it.
    - See *[Raffles v. Wichelhaus](link)*

### The Offer
#### Corbin on Contracts
  - Offer is an expression by one party of assent to certain definite terms, provided that the other party involved in the bargaining transaction will likewise express assent to the same terms.
    - Contract law must determine whether a reasonable person, acquainted with all the circumstances, would believe that the author of the communication alleged to be an offer intended to be bound upon assent(acceptance) by the other party.

#### Unilateral Offers
- Where the offer is clear, definite, and explicit, and leaves nothing open for negotiation, it constitutes an offer, acceptance of which will complete the contract.
- Store intended to be held to the offer
  - See *[Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, Inc.](link)*

#### Limits on Unilateral Offers
- Advertisements are generally invitations. Targeted to mass of individuals.
  - See *[Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Russell](link)*
    - A reasonable person would understand that not every person qualifies for financing.
    - A reasonable person also knows there are not an unlimted amount of cars being sold

### The Acceptance
- General Approach is to look for a particular communication that constitutes an offer and another communication that constitues an acceptance.
-
#### Corbin Offer and Acceptance
  - An acceptance is a voluntary act of the offeree whereby he exercises the power conferred upon him by the offer and thereby creates the set of legal relations called a contract.

#### Acceptance of an Offer
- Uniform Commercial Code §2-206(1)(a)
  - Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances
    - **an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances**
- Restatement (Second of Contracts) §32 - Invitation of Promsie or Performance
  - In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.
- See *[Bergey v. HSBC Bank USA](link)*

#### Qualified Acceptance
- Conditions on an agreement are considered qualified agreements and are not agreements at all.
  - See *[Ardente v Horan](Link)*


#### Acceptance by Silence or Partial Performance
- Partial Performance
  - See *[White v. Corlies](link)*
- Restatement §69 Acceptance by silence or exercise of dominion
  - Where an offeree fails to reply to an offer, his silence and inaction operates as an acceptance in the following cases only:
    - Where an offeree takes the benefit of offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation
    - Where the oferor has stated or given the offeree reason to understand that assent may be manifested by silence or inaction and the offeree in remaining silent and inactive intends to accept the offer
    - Where because of previous dealings or otherwise it is reasonable that the offeree should notify the oferor if he does not intend to accept.
    - An offeree who does any act inconsistent with the offeror's ownership of offered property is bound in accordance with the offered terms unless they are manifestly unreasonable. But if the act is wrongful as against the offeror it is an acceptance only if ratifed by him.
