# The Performance Process
## Substantive Content of the Duty to Perform
### The Performance Stage & The Role of Lawyers
- The parties agreement (not general law) specifies the content of their duties.
- Lawyer must understand how courts resolve disputes involving the content and meaning of agreements


### Contract Terms and Parol Evidence Rules
- Parol Evidence Rule: When two parties have made a contract and have expressed it in a writing to which they have both assented as to the complete and accurate integration of that contract, evidence, whether parol or otherwise, of antecedent understandings and negotiations will not be admitted for the purpose of varying or contradicting the writing.
  - Variations of the Rule: Seek some middle position between blind adherence to the language of a written agreement and total willingness to give binding effect to all extrinsic evidence of antecedent agreements, understandings, or negotiations that may affect the writing.
  - Parol Evidence does not govern post-contract statements or conduct



#### Parol Evidence Rule
- Some want a “lawyer’s Paradise” where **written instruments have a precise**, **fixed meaning**.
  - But in reality, context is a “fatal necessity
- Serves as a filter that controls **evidence** a party can introduce at trial to prove the terms of the contract, barring evidence of a prior or contemporaneous oral arguments or promises that contradict or vary a term in writing the parties intend to be complete with respect of the term.
  - Deters untruthful attacks on the terms of the contract
  - Written contracts not prone to fading memory
  - Enforces Proper Consideration
  - Wary of jury's swayed by sympathetic parties

- Baseline: Courts should not allow oral evidence of agreements
- Traditional: A court would admit evidence only if it did not contradict or vary the written contract or if the parties did not intend the writing to be complete on the issue.


#### Collateral Contract Exception
- Intended to be outside the written contract to be enforcable without worrying about the written contract.
  - Separate Consideration v. Same Consideration
- See *[Mitchill v. Lathe](link)*
  - “The court barred evidence of the promise on the theory that the promise, if made, would have been part of the written contract”
- Integration: Complete v. Partial Integration
  - Complete: Everything that they agreed to was in the writing
  - Partial: Terms and Contract only incorperates soem of the terms of the Contract
- 3 Conditions for Integration
  - Agreement must in form be a collateral one
  - Must not contradict express or implied provisions of the written contract
  - Must be one that parties would not ordinarily be expected to embody in the writing.


- If the parties might reasonably have left terms out of the agreement, the court can admit evidence of the parties’ intent and oral agreements. For instance, in a purchase option agreement, the parties might not have written down a provision that the option was personal to that party and nonassignable.
- Evidence of oral collateral agreements should be excluded only when the fact finder is likely to be misled. The rule must therefore be based on the credibility of the evidence.
  - See *[Masterson v. Sine](link)*

#### Clear Fixed Terms & Merger Clause
- Merger (or integration) clauses provide that the written contract is the entire agreement between the parties.
- Often, a merger clause is not enough to prove complete integration. Courts often hold that the parties must have actually assented to integration.
  - Courts must consider surrounding circumstances to determine whether the parties actually assented to the merger clause.
- But if Contract terms are unambiguous and clear there is nothing for the court to construe. Oral agreements cannot contradict the unambiguous and clear terms of the contract.
  - Inconsistent with principles of parol evidence rule
   - See *[Baker v. Bailey](link)*

#### Debate on Parol Evidence Role
 - Williston: The existence of the oral agreement proves that the written agreement was only a partial intergration. The only question would be whether the parties actually made the alleged prior oral agreement. A written expression is presumptively a complete integration unless it would be natural for similarly situated parties to add additional terms in a separate (oral) agreement
 - Corbin: Williston’s approach—excluding relevant evidence of intent except the writing itself is absurd.

#### UCC - Parol or Extrinsic Evidence
UCC § 2-202 reflects Corbin’s influence in its focus on the intent of the par- ties, rather than the practices of reasonable people.

#### Interpretation of Written Contracts
- Plain Meaning
- Ambiguity Exception


#### Ambiguity Exception
- A court must admit parol evidence if a writing is unclear even if the parties intended the writing to be complete
- Language in Contract must be reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning
- A contract is ambiguous when its meaning is genuinely uncertain and doubtful or when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.
  - See *[Gold Kist Inc. v. Carr](link)*
    - A judge must determine the issue simply by reading the contract without the aid of extrinsic evidence
- Plain Meaning Rule
  - See *[Greenfield v. Philles Records, Inc.](link)*

#### Ambiguity Rule
- But language lacks fixed meaning. “Accordingly, rational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties.
  - See *[Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co.](link)*

#### Anti-Ambiguity Critique of Treynor in Pacific Gas
  - See *[Trident Center v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.]


#### Treynor v. Kozinski
  - Language lacks fixed meaning. “Accordingly, rational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties.”
    - See Traynor in *[Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co.](link)*
  - There are some cases where the plain meaning of language really is unambiguous. Kozinski grudgingly agreed that the external evidence must be allowed under the California Supreme Court’s holding in Pacific Gas—which “we have no difficulty understanding . . . , even without extrinsic evidence to guide us.”
    - See Kozinski in [Trident Center v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.]
  - What exactly wrong with following the PG & E rule? If the language is in fact unambiguous, the case will easily fall at trial. The only cost is judicial inefficiency, which is costly in terms of time and money, but not analytically.

#### Preliminary Custom & Negotiations on Plain Meaning
- Plain meaning v. Course of Performance, Use of Trade & Course of Dealing
  - See *[Eskimo Pie Corp. v. Whitelawn Dairies, Inc.](link)*

#### The "Condition Precedent" Exception to the Parol Evidence Rule


### Interpretation of Terms
  - There is no single, literal meaning of a phrase

#### Exceptions to Objective Interpretation of Contracts
- Mutual understanding is not private and is therefore valid.
- “When it appears that the understanding of one is the understanding of both, no violation of the rule results from determination of the mutual understanding according to that of one alone.”
  - See *[Berke Moore Co. v. Phoenix Bridge Co.](link)*

#### Custom in Contract Interpretation
- Although a court may look to known customs or usages in a particular industry to determine the meaning of a contract, the parties must prove those customs or usages using affirmative evidentiary support in a given case.
  - See *[M&G Polymers USA v. Tacett](link)*


#### Custom in Contract Interpretation
- Although a court may look to known customs or usages in a particular industry to determine the meaning of a contract, the parties must prove those customs or usages using affirmative evidentiary support in a given case.
  - Court cannot use its own suppositions on how Unions work & negotiate instead of basing it on **Objective** evidence of how Unions negotiate
  - Evidence over inferences
    - See *[M&G Polymers USA v. Tacett](link)*
- The UCC defines “agreement” to include “implications from other circumstances,” including trade usage, thus broadening the definition of contract.
  - UCC 201
    - Agreement means the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or inferred from the "
- UCC 303
  - Default to Express terms when in conflict with course of performance and trade usage

#### Gap Fillers
- The UCC “gap-filler” provisions fill the gaps that parties may leave in contracts for sale of goods.
  - **Default rules**: background rules that the law reads into a contract only if the parties left them out.
  - **Mandatory rules**: not waivable by the parties, e.g., the requirement of consideration.
    - See *[Haines v. City of New York](Link)*
      - Scope: The parties disagreed over whether New York City had an obligation to expand a sewage system arising from a much earlier agreement.
        - Unreasonable to expect over capacity system to take new properties that were not negotiated or part of the original contract
      - Duration: “ . . . where the parties have not clearly expressed the duration of a contract, the courts will imply that they intended performance to continue for a reasonable time.”
        - Policy Considerations demonstrate that Duration was not an intent of the parties to the contract
          - Reasonable Time Standard - Until the Water was no longer needed
          - Court does not want to "write the contract" and it is better to defer to party intent and fill in the gap for duration
              - Reasonable Time does not apply to employment contract which could lead to involuntary servitude
                - At Will Time
          - See *[Keppy v. Lilienthal](link)*
            - Fairly Implied Duration: At Will is determined unless there is evidence on both sides to consider that there was a duration term or intent for a duration.

#### Interpretation v. Gap Filling
- Hopes v. Committments; Goals v. Promises
  - See *[Yonkers v. Otis Elevator Co.](link)*

-Short of this extreme, courts are inclined to fill gaps for the parties, rather than give up on the contract
  - See *[Haslund v. SImon Property Group Inc](link)*
    - “If contracting parties had to provide for every contingency that might arise, contract negotiations would be interminable. Contracts can be shorter and simpler and cheaper when courts stand ready to fill gaps and resolve ambiguities in the minority of contracts that get drawn into litigation.”

- Assessing damages is often and permissibly speculative, but only within limits. A plaintiff has the burden of proving damages to a reasonable degree of certainty.
- A contract is rightly deemed unenforceable for indefiniteness when it leaves out a crucial term that a court cannot reasonably be asked to supply in the name of interpretation.
  - See *[Southwest Engineering Co. v. Martain Tractor Co.](link)*



### Good Faith
- Holding “sole discretion” is not equivalent of “for any reason whatsoever, no matter how arbitrary or unreasonable”
  - See *[Tymshare Inc. v. Covell]
- Posner
  - “There is a legally enforceable contract duty of ‘good faith,’ but it is just a duty to avoid exploiting the temporary monopoly position that a contracting party will sometimes obtain during the course of performance.”





#### No Oral Modification Clauses
  - The parol evidence rule applies only to oral agreements made before or contemporaneously with a written, integrated contract.
    - The rule doesn’t apply to a later agreement that modifies the integration.
