# The Performance Process
## Substantive Content of the Duty to Perform
### The Performance Stage & The Role of Lawyers
- The parties agreement (not general law) specifies the content of their duties.
- Lawyer must understand how courts resolve disputes involving the content and meaning of agreements


### Contract Terms and Parol Evidence Rules
- Parol Evidence Rule: When two parties have made a contract and have expressed it in a writing to which they have both assented as to the complete and accurate integration of that contract, evidence, whether parol or otherwise, of antecedent understandings and negotiations will not be admitted for the purpose of varying or contradicting the writing.
  - Variations of the Rule: Seek some middle position between blind adherence to the language of a written agreement and total willingness to give binding effect to all extrinsic evidence of antecedent agreements, understandings, or negotiations that may affect the writing.
  - Parol Evidence does not govern post-contract statements or conduct



#### Parol Evidence Rule
- Some want a “lawyer’s Paradise” where **written instruments have a precise**, **fixed meaning**.
  - But in reality, context is a “fatal necessity
- Serves as a filter that controls **evidence** a party can introduce at trial to prove the terms of the contract, barring evidence of a prior or contemporaneous oral arguments or promises that contradict or vary a term in writing the parties intend to be complete with respect of the term.
  - Deters untruthful attacks on the terms of the contract
  - Written contracts not prone to fading memory
  - Enforces Proper Consideration
  - Wary of jury's swayed by sympathetic parties

- Baseline: Courts should not allow oral evidence of agreements
- Traditional: A court would admit evidence only if it did not contradict or vary the written contract or if the parties did not intend the writing to be complete on the issue.


#### Collateral Contract Exception
- Intended to be outside the written contract to be enforcable without worrying about the written contract.
  - Separate Consideration v. Same Consideration
- See *[Mitchill v. Lathe](link)*
  - “The court barred evidence of the promise on the theory that the promise, if made, would have been part of the written contract”
- Integration: Complete v. Partial Integration
  - Complete: Everything that they agreed to was in the writing
  - Partial: Terms and Contract only incorperates soem of the terms of the Contract
- 3 Conditions for Integration
  - Agreement must in form be a collateral one
  - Must not contradict express or implied provisions of the written contract
  - Must be one that parties would not ordinarily be expected to embody in the writing.


- If the parties might reasonably have left terms out of the agreement, the court can admit evidence of the parties’ intent and oral agreements. For instance, in a purchase option agreement, the parties might not have written down a provision that the option was personal to that party and nonassignable.
- Evidence of oral collateral agreements should be excluded only when the fact finder is likely to be misled. The rule must therefore be based on the credibility of the evidence.
  - See *[Masterson v. Sine](link)*

#### Clear Fixed Terms & Merger Clause
- Merger (or integration) clauses provide that the written contract is the entire agreement between the parties.
- Often, a merger clause is not enough to prove complete integration. Courts often hold that the parties must have actually assented to integration.
  - Courts must consider surrounding circumstances to determine whether the parties actually assented to the merger clause.
- But if Contract terms are unambiguous and clear there is nothing for the court to construe. Oral agreements cannot contradict the unambiguous and clear terms of the contract.
  - Inconsistent with principles of parol evidence rule
   - See *[Baker v. Bailey](link)*

#### Debate on Parol Evidence Role
 - Williston: The existence of the oral agreement proves that the written agreement was only a partial intergration. The only question would be whether the parties actually made the alleged prior oral agreement. A written expression is presumptively a complete integration unless it would be natural for similarly situated parties to add additional terms in a separate (oral) agreement
 - Corbin: Williston’s approach—excluding relevant evidence of intent except the writing itself is absurd.

#### UCC - Parol or Extrinsic Evidence
UCC § 2-202 reflects Corbin’s influence in its focus on the intent of the par- ties, rather than the practices of reasonable people.
####

#### Ambiguity Exception
- A court must admit parol evidence if a writing is unclear even if the parties intended the writing to be complete
- Language in Contract must be reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning
- A contract is ambiguous when its meaning is genuinely uncertain and doubtful or when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.
  - See *[Gold Kist Inc. v. Carr](link)*
    - A judge must determine the issue simply by reading the contract without the aid of extrinsic evidence
- Plain Meaning Rule
  - See *[Greenfield v. Philles Records, Inc.](link)*

- But language lacks fixed meaning. “Accordingly, rational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties.
  - See *[Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co.](link)*
