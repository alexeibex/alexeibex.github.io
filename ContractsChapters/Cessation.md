### Cessation and The Role of Lawyer

### Invalidity and Related Defenses - A Brief Retrospect

### Mutual Mistake

### Impossibility of Performance

#### Implied Conditions
- In contracts in which the performance depends on the continued existence of a given person or thing, a condition is implied that the possibility of performance arising from the perishing or the person or thing shall excuse the performance.
  - See *[Taylor v. Caldwell](link)*

- Subjective impossibility is no excuse for performance.
  - Performance must be objectively impossible in order to serve as an excuse.
    - See *[Canadian Industrial Alcohol Co. v. Dunbar Molasses Co.](link)*
      - Performance of that obligation is not excused by impossibility absent extreme or unavoidable circumstances.
        - Here, it wasn’t **objectively** impossible. So here it was just **subjectively** impossible (cause you weren’t responsible enough, etc). Could have put in express condition precedent. 
        - Exceptions for excuse
          - Unavoidable strikes, acts of god, nature
      - If the plaintiff had been so informed, it would very likely have preferred to deal with the refinery directly, instead of dealing with a middleman.
        - Counter: Implied in fact condition given that both parties had explicitly indicated supply of sugar from 3rd party, but courts are narrow to interpret an excuse.

#### Standard for Impossibility
- Supervening event
  - After contract has been formed, something interferes with the contract. (act of God, or Nature)
- Absolute Impossibility
  - Fire clauses/force majeure — generally impossibility excuse not allowed bc they allocate risk to the promisor
  - When contract allocates risk to one of the parties, impossibility defense will not be allowed.


#### Impracticability of Performance
- When the parties put something expressly in, then the courts will go with that contractual expression. No need to imply a condition like in Taylor v. Caldwell.
  - See *[Marcovich Land Co. v. J.J. Newberry Co.](link)*
    - Impossibility Argument: No ability to get financing to rebuild
      - But did not get replacement insurance instead got present value, therefore No Impossibility Excuse
    - Impracticability: Technically possible but financially burdensome (400k to build but only received 200k)

- Performance becomes “impossible in legal contemplation” if it is beyond practicality
- Where it is commercially senseless to enforce a contract, it should be excused for impracticability.
  - When performance is excessively more expensive then anticipated, it may be excused.
    - See *[Mineral Park Land Co. v. Howard](link)*
      - The rest of the gravel and earth on the plaintiffs’ land was impractical (and thus “impossible in legal contemplation”) to retrieve.
        - Begins to look like **mutual mistake** as opposed to mutual misunderstanding *[Peerless](link)*
        - Existing impossibility - that existed at K formation aleviates mistake element
- Allocation of Risk Analyiss
- Foreseeability and appreciation of risk is probative of risk allocation but is not conclusive
- When something is foreseeable, and if performance is not excessively costly, then there is no impracticability.
  - See *[Translatlanic Financing Corp. v. United States](link)*
    - Fails an 3rd prong of impracticability test—not prohibitively expensive.
    - Foreseeability or even recognition of a risk does not necessarily prove its risk allocation.
      - Parties to a contract are not always able to provide for all the possibilities of which they are aware, sometimes because they cannot agree, often simply because they are too busy.
    - The foreseeability of an event, or the fact that a risk was foreseen, should be probative factors in the risk allocation puzzle, perhaps heavily-weighted ones, but foreseeability should not preclude other inquiries.
    - Quantum Meruit Recovery plus K price
      - Cannot recover for both on the contract and off the contract.
      - Transatlantic already collected on the Contract Price
        - See *[Posner v. Seder](link)*

#### UCC & Impossibility
- The doctrine of impossibility excuses performance upon the occurrence of a contingency that is beyond the scope of risks that were contemplated or assigned among the parties.
  - Under the Uniform Commercial Code, performance is excusable if: 
    - The performance has become impracticable, and 
    - The impracticability was caused by the occurrence of a contingency, the **non-occurrence** of which was a basic assumption of the parties. (Assumption of Risk/Allocation of Risk)
      - See *[Mishara Construction v. Transit-Mixed](link)*



### Frustration of Purpose
- Test for Frustration of Purpose:
  - What was foundation of the contract?
  - Was performance prevented?
  - Was the event which prevented performance foreseeably?
- Note: Not all contemplations are necessarily memorialized in the contract. When it is determined reasonable for one to anticipate something they should have protected against it by allocating risk into a contractual clause.
- When the purpose/motivation behind a deal does not occur, and is not anticipated by either party at the time of the bargaining, the contract may be excused for frustration of purpose.
  - See *[Krell v. Henry](link)*
    - Performance was excused, because the **essential purpose** of the contract (watch coronation) failed, and that failure was not **contemplated by the parties.**
      - It must be determined whether the condition is actually the subject matter of the contract, whether performance of this subject matter was somehow prevented, and whether the event preventing performance was not reasonably foreseeable by the parties at the time of contract formation – if it is the subject matter,
      - Additionally, the cancellation of the coronation ceremonies due to the king’s illness is such a remote occurrence that it was incapable of being contemplated by the parties when forming their contract.
    - Additional: Here, performance was still possible, but **the motive and incentive** and **point to the contract** was gone and the event was not **reasonably foreseeable** so the excuse was allowed.
      - See *[Taylor v. Caldwell](link)
        - Same applicable principle
