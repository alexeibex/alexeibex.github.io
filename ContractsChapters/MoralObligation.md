# Obligation: Moral Obligation

## Moral Obligation Theory
- Moral obligations do not make promises enforceable.
- **Past consideration** is required.
  - Traditionally, there are **three areas** in which a promise to discharge a prior unenforceable obligation is binding:
    - A promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations.
    - A promise by an adult to a pay a debt incurred when the person is underage.
    - A promise to pay a debt that has been discharged by bankruptcy.
  - Equity can compel courts to depart from the rule [*Webb v. McGown*](https://alexeibex.github.io/Contracts#case-webb-v-mcgowin)
  - Past Consideration is sometimes binding. Some cases are “gratuitous transactions” (with no consideration) and “quasi-contracts” (with consideration, if justice requires).

#### Case Law:
- *Mills v. Wyman*
- *Webb v. McGowin*
- *Edson v. Poppe*

### Restatement of Contracts §86
#### Promise for Benefit Receieved
1. A promise made in recognition of a benefit previously recieved by the promisor from the promisee is binding to the extent necessary to prevent injustice
2. A promise is not binding under Subsection (1):
  1. IF the promisee conferred the benefit as a gift or for other reasons the promisor has not been unjustly enriched;
  2. To the extent that its value is disproportionate to the benefit.

### Example
- If A confers a benefit on B without B’s prior request, the subsequent relationship could fall into three categories:
  - B is legally obligated to compensate A under the law of unjust enrichment—for instance, if A paid B money by mistake. The Restatement (Second) adopts this approach, though courts traditionally did not recognize it.
  - B is morally but not legally obligated to compensate A—for instance, if B has suffered a loss on rescuing A. *Mills v. Wyman.*
  - B is neither morally nor legally obligated to compensate A— e.g., ordinary gifts.
