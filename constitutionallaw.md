### 1.4 Authority & Role of the Supreme Court

#### 1.4.1 The Power of Judicial Review

Does the Court have the final word in constitutional interpretation? **Both Congress and the Executive Branch** also interpret the Constitution, but whose say is final?

##### Historical Context of Judicial Review
1. Adams had issued and signed an order appointing Marbury a justice of the peace. Marshall, then Secretary of State, failed to deliver it before the end of the Adams administration. Jefferson and Madison, the new Secretary of State, refused to deliver it. Marbury sued in December 1801 to receive the commission.
2. The “peculiar delicacy” of the case was its contentious political context and the impact of the Court’s decision on the relations between the branches of government. Madison’s failure to appear in court resulted from the controversy.


<b>Case: <i>[Marbury v. Madison](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/c36871a6-f343-4439-92c2-c20a624e1549/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Even though an applicant had a legal right to his appointment as justice of the peace, he was not entitled to a mandamus because the act giving the U.S. Supreme Court authority to issue a mandamus to an officer violated the Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Did Marbury have a right to the commission?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> The commission was complete when the President signed it and the Secretary of State affixed the U.S. seal.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to the commission, did he have right to a legal remedy? When can courts review the executive’s actions?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> Acts “in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion . . . are only politically examinable” i.e., they are beyond judicial review. <b>BUT</b> when the act arises under a legal duty, “<b>and individual rights</b> depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . ”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The Rule of Law: <i>“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”</i> Compare to Louis XIV: “The State, it is I.”</li>
                <li>The question of whether an officer as an individual has a vested right in his appointment, and therefore whether the President can remove him at will, is for the courts. Therefore the courts can review Marbury’s dispute.</li>
                <li>Whether a right is vested is a question for the courts to decide and is not coferring <b>the political question doctrine</b>.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to a remedy, was it a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court? Can the Court enforce the remedy? Can the Court declare a statute to be unconstitutional? Why?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system, authorized the Supreme Court to issue mandamus to lower courts or officials. Madison was an official, so mandamus was unavailable only if the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
              <li>Marshall: "The Constitution granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in only two types of cases (those involving ambassadors, etc., and those in which a state is a party). The Constitution’s division of the Court’s jurisdiction between original and appellate meant that it did not intend to give Congress the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction.</li>
              <li>Congress therefore did not have the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction. <b>§13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</b></li>
              <li><b>Constitutional Supremacy</b>(LINK): the Supremacy Clause established the Constitution as the “supreme law of the land.” so verse the statute, the constitution holds power</li>
              <li><b>Judicial Review (LINK):</b> Limited government requires the Court to review the constitutionality of statutes. <b>“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</b></li>
            </ul>
      </ol>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Supreme Court's jurisdiction was given by statute. Interpretation of the statute allowed for jurisdiction but also brought it into conflict with the Constitution.</li>
        <li>Courts have the ability to judge cases that "arise under" the Constitution.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>Jefferson calls holding "dictum" because the case was dismissed. Not binding law.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

##### Theories of Judicial Review
1. Judicial interpretation: First or Last Word?
   - Is the court’s role mainly to legitimize the national government’s actions or to invalidate them?
2. Judicial supremacy and judicial finality
   - Do other branches have to accept Court decisions as authoritative (judicial supremacy)? Does the court get the last word, or do other branches also have the authority to interpret the Constitution (judicial finality/exclusivity)?
3. Departmentalism:
  - Each Branch of government can interpret the constitution.

##### Frameworks of Beneath the Theories of Judicial Review
1. Functionalism
  - The Court’s actions contribute to maintaining a certain kind of American polity. Judiciary represents, "We The People" as a check on Congress and the Executive Branch.
2. Originalism and Textualism
 - The Court acts on the framers’ intent or on its reading of the text itself.



#### 1.4.2 Supreme Court Authority to Review State Court Judgements
Vertical Power over the states.
"The Constituion bristols with limits over states..."

###### Judiciary oversees interactions within the federal government and between the federal government and the states.
  - The Court rejects the dual soveriengty idea and replaces it with interlocking oversight.



<b>Case: <i>[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/b6a39380-672b-4b93-8fdb-f7bb6d7d8c42/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> The Supreme Court of the United States had appellate power over a final judgement from a state court of appeals because the matter concerned an issue arising under a treaty of the United States.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff appealed from the Court of Appeals of Virginia which found for defendant in plaintiff's action of ejectment, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed. The court of appeals refused to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court because it determined that the appellate power of the Supreme Court did not extend to the state court of appeals. The case was once again brought to the Supreme Court on writ of error.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the Supreme Court of the United States has appellate jurisdiction over the state court of appeals.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial power of the United States, except in courts ordained and established by itself; and if in any of the cases enumerated in the constitution, the state courts did not then possess jurisdiction, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (admitting that it could act on state courts) could not reach those cases, and, consequently, the injunction of the constitution, that the judicial power "shall be vested," would be disobeyed. It would seem, therefore, to follow, that congress are bound to create some inferior courts, in which to vest all that jurisdiction which, under the constitution, is exclusively vested in the United States, and of which the supreme court cannot take original cognizance. They might establish one or more inferior courts; they might parcel out the jurisdiction among such courts, from time to time, at their own pleasure. But the whole judicial power of the United States should be, at all times, vested either in an original or appellate form, in some courts created under its authority.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Appellate jurisdiction is over the case not the court. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over cases that involve any of the enumerated issues (SMJ) outlined in Article 3 of the Constitution. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> The Court’s power to review state court decisions and the constitutionality of state court decisions is well established. See §25 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789</li>

</ul>

</details>



##### 1.4.2.1 Supreme Court Review of State Criminal Cases
*"The judicial power extends to all cases arising under the constitution or a law of the United States, whoever may be the parties" * - Marshall

Power granted by §25 of the 1789 Judiciary act

<b>Case: <i>[Cohens v. Virginia](Link)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Criminal charges decided on the merits against ∆ selling DC lottery tickets in violation of Virgina Law. Supreme Court had jurisdiction to review state judgements.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether the Supreme Court can hear Criminal Cases from the State and Local Governments.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> State judges are more susceptible to state legislatures. State itself was a party to the case, as a result Supreme Court has jurisdiction under the Constitution.</li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

#### 1.4.3 Judicial Exclusivity
*"It is emphatically *the province* and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is"* - Marshall

##### Supreme Court Decision Are Binding
- Supreme Court are the "Keepers of the Flame" of the Constitution
- Opinion written by all 9 justices.

<b>Case: <i>[Cooper v. Aaron](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-cooper-v-aaron.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Following Brown v. Board of Ed, Arkansas Governor refused to allow for desgregation. Case arose out of school board seeking postponement of desgregation. District court granted because of "chaos, bedlam, and turmoil" The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to all action of a state denying equal protection of the laws, whatever the agency of the state taking the action; moreover, the Constitution was the supreme law of the land.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Should the program for desegregation be postponed?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> No state legislator or executive or judicicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Constiution is the Supreme Law of the Land</li>
      <li>The Supreme Court's job is to say what the Law is</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's word is supreme</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's decisions are the Supreme Law of the Land.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Critique of Cooper distinguishing the Constitution v. What the Supreme Court says about the Constitution in its decisions.</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court Interpretations of the Constiution may not be overruled by an Act of Congress

Supreme Court is the final word on Constiutional interpretation

<b>Case: <i>[Dickerson v. United States](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-dickerson-v-united-states.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Denial of petitioner's motion to suppress was reversed, since Miranda had announced a constitutional rule that could not be superseded legislatively, and the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. Miranda being a Constituional decision cannot be overruled by an act of Congress.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> May Miranda, being a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Miranda and its progeny in the Supreme Court govern the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court reversed, finding that Miranda was a constitutional decision of the court, and therefore could not be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress. Further, following the principles of stare decisis, the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. The court held that Miranda and its progeny governed the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court over the Executive Branch

Judiciary set its own limits on the executive branch. Only has jurisdiction over executive agents in certain situations.
Big bark but no bite? Presidents will obey orders of court but generally talk a big game.

- Jefferson: *"Co-ordinate branches should be checks on each other, but for the Legislative & Executive in their spheres would make the judiciary a despotic branch"*
- Jackson: *"The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges, and on that point the President is independent of both."*
- Lincoln
- Roosevelt

##### 1.4.4 Political Restraints on the Supreme Court

##### 1. Judicial Selection: The Nomination and Confirmation Process
<details>

<ul>
  <li>Justices nominated by the President but Article 2 provides that the appointment will not be effective unless the President obtains the *"Advice and Consent of the Senate"*</li>
  <li>Prior to new deal era, Senate only rejected on grounds of inompetence or defects in character or temperment.</li>
  <li>People elect the President and the Senate, ergo they can help guide judicial appointments through indirect control</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### 2. Impeachment: Justices appointed to the court *"to hold their Offices during good Behaviour"* (Article 3)

<details>
<ul>
  <li>Presumed to confer life tenure</li>
  <li>May be removed from office on Impeachment for and "Conviction of Treason, Bribery or other High Crimes & Misdemeanors" (Article 2)</li>
  <li>Ideological disagreement with a sitting Justice is not a proper ground for impeachment.</li>
</ul>
</details>

##### 3. Structural Interference: Congress sets the size of and budge for the Court.
  - Executive Court Packing
  - Justice salaries cannot be diminished during their Continuance in Office (Article 3)
  - Potential source of political checking power

##### 4. Jurisdiction-Stripping
  - Congress has the power to make "exceptions" to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. (Article 3)

##### 5. Constitutional Amendment
  - Article 5 permits amendment of almost every provision (Article 5)
  - 2 Methods for initiating the amendment process:
    1. Congress, by a ***2/3rds*** vote may propose amendments for ratification by ***3/4ths*** of the states
    2. OR ***2/3rds*** of the states may apply to Congress to call a constitutional convention for "Proposing Amendments"
    - Amendments to overturn specific Supreme Court rulings have been ratified only 4 times since founding.
      - **(11th, 14th, 16th, 26th)**

#### 1.4.5 Political Questions & The Political Thicket (Limits)
*"Questions, in their nature political, or which are, by the Constitution and laws, submitted to the executive can never be made in this court"* - Marshall

##### Limits on Court:
  - "A case or controvery ***(must)*** arises under the Constituion"
  - Limits on Political Questions that the Court can hear
  - Will not do advisory opinions
  - Will not do cases where parties have no standing
  - Will not do cases that are too old or too soon
  - Will not do cases that are moot

##### Political Question Doctrine:

***The Supreme Court does not resolve political questions.*** Those questions are resolved through the political process.
1. That some matters are committed to the unreviewable discretion of the political branches, AND
  - Constitutional interpretation
2. That some otherwise legal questions ought to be left to the other branches as a matter of prudence.
  - Judicial Discretion

  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, residents of several counties, filed a complaint against defendants, state officers and election officials, alleging that a state statute arbitrarily and capriciously appointed representatives without reference to any logical or rational formula and that it deprived them of the equal protection of the laws in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the District Court may declare a malapportionment legislature unconstitutional without raising a political question.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> A federal court cannot pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because it is irreconcilable with the United States Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed and remanded, holding that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which plaintiffs were entitled to a trial and a decision. The right that plaintiffs asserted was within the reach of judicial protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>
