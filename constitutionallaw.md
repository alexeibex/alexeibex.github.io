### 1.4 Authority & Role of the Supreme Court

#### 1.4.1 The Power of Judicial Review

Does the Court have the final word in constitutional interpretation? **Both Congress and the Executive Branch** also interpret the Constitution, but whose say is final?

##### Historical Context of Judicial Review
1. Adams had issued and signed an order appointing Marbury a justice of the peace. Marshall, then Secretary of State, failed to deliver it before the end of the Adams administration. Jefferson and Madison, the new Secretary of State, refused to deliver it. Marbury sued in December 1801 to receive the commission.
2. The “peculiar delicacy” of the case was its contentious political context and the impact of the Court’s decision on the relations between the branches of government. Madison’s failure to appear in court resulted from the controversy.


<b>Case: <i>[Marbury v. Madison](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/c36871a6-f343-4439-92c2-c20a624e1549/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Even though an applicant had a legal right to his appointment as justice of the peace, he was not entitled to a mandamus because the act giving the U.S. Supreme Court authority to issue a mandamus to an officer violated the Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Did Marbury have a right to the commission?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> The commission was complete when the President signed it and the Secretary of State affixed the U.S. seal.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to the commission, did he have right to a legal remedy? When can courts review the executive’s actions?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> Acts “in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion . . . are only politically examinable” i.e., they are beyond judicial review. <b>BUT</b> when the act arises under a legal duty, “<b>and individual rights</b> depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . ”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The Rule of Law: <i>“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”</i> Compare to Louis XIV: “The State, it is I.”</li>
                <li>The question of whether an officer as an individual has a vested right in his appointment, and therefore whether the President can remove him at will, is for the courts. Therefore the courts can review Marbury’s dispute.</li>
                <li>Whether a right is vested is a question for the courts to decide and is not coferring <b>the political question doctrine</b>.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to a remedy, was it a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court? Can the Court enforce the remedy? Can the Court declare a statute to be unconstitutional? Why?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system, authorized the Supreme Court to issue mandamus to lower courts or officials. Madison was an official, so mandamus was unavailable only if the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
              <li>Marshall: "The Constitution granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in only two types of cases (those involving ambassadors, etc., and those in which a state is a party). The Constitution’s division of the Court’s jurisdiction between original and appellate meant that it did not intend to give Congress the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction.</li>
              <li>Congress therefore did not have the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction. <b>§13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</b></li>
              <li><b>Constitutional Supremacy</b>(LINK): the Supremacy Clause established the Constitution as the “supreme law of the land.” so verse the statute, the constitution holds power</li>
              <li><b>Judicial Review (LINK):</b> Limited government requires the Court to review the constitutionality of statutes. <b>“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</b></li>
            </ul>
      </ol>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Supreme Court's jurisdiction was given by statute. Interpretation of the statute allowed for jurisdiction but also brought it into conflict with the Constitution.</li>
        <li>Courts have the ability to judge cases that "arise under" the Constitution.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>Jefferson calls holding "dictum" because the case was dismissed. Not binding law.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

##### Theories of Judicial Review
1. Judicial interpretation: First or Last Word?
   - Is the court’s role mainly to legitimize the national government’s actions or to invalidate them?
2. Judicial supremacy and judicial finality
   - Do other branches have to accept Court decisions as authoritative (judicial supremacy)? Does the court get the last word, or do other branches also have the authority to interpret the Constitution (judicial finality/exclusivity)?
3. Departmentalism:
  - Each Branch of government can interpret the constitution.

##### Frameworks of Beneath the Theories of Judicial Review
1. Functionalism
  - The Court’s actions contribute to maintaining a certain kind of American polity. Judiciary represents, "We The People" as a check on Congress and the Executive Branch.
2. Originalism and Textualism
 - The Court acts on the framers’ intent or on its reading of the text itself.



#### 1.4.2 Supreme Court Authority to Review State Court Judgements
Vertical Power over the states.
"The Constituion bristols with limits over states..."

###### Judiciary oversees interactions within the federal government and between the federal government and the states.
  - The Court rejects the dual soveriengty idea and replaces it with interlocking oversight.



<b>Case: <i>[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/b6a39380-672b-4b93-8fdb-f7bb6d7d8c42/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> The Supreme Court of the United States had appellate power over a final judgement from a state court of appeals because the matter concerned an issue arising under a treaty of the United States.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff appealed from the Court of Appeals of Virginia which found for defendant in plaintiff's action of ejectment, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed. The court of appeals refused to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court because it determined that the appellate power of the Supreme Court did not extend to the state court of appeals. The case was once again brought to the Supreme Court on writ of error.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the Supreme Court of the United States has appellate jurisdiction over the state court of appeals.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial power of the United States, except in courts ordained and established by itself; and if in any of the cases enumerated in the constitution, the state courts did not then possess jurisdiction, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (admitting that it could act on state courts) could not reach those cases, and, consequently, the injunction of the constitution, that the judicial power "shall be vested," would be disobeyed. It would seem, therefore, to follow, that congress are bound to create some inferior courts, in which to vest all that jurisdiction which, under the constitution, is exclusively vested in the United States, and of which the supreme court cannot take original cognizance. They might establish one or more inferior courts; they might parcel out the jurisdiction among such courts, from time to time, at their own pleasure. But the whole judicial power of the United States should be, at all times, vested either in an original or appellate form, in some courts created under its authority.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Appellate jurisdiction is over the case not the court. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over cases that involve any of the enumerated issues (SMJ) outlined in Article 3 of the Constitution. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> The Court’s power to review state court decisions and the constitutionality of state court decisions is well established. See §25 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789</li>

</ul>

</details>



#### 1.4.2.1 Supreme Court Review of State Criminal Cases
*"The judicial power extends to all cases arising under the constitution or a law of the United States, whoever may be the parties"* - Marshall

Power granted by §25 of the 1789 Judiciary act

<b>Case: <i>[Cohens v. Virginia](Link)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Criminal charges decided on the merits against ∆ selling DC lottery tickets in violation of Virgina Law. Supreme Court had jurisdiction to review state judgements.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether the Supreme Court can hear Criminal Cases from the State and Local Governments.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> State judges are more susceptible to state legislatures. State itself was a party to the case, as a result Supreme Court has jurisdiction under the Constitution.</li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

#### 1.4.3 Judicial Exclusivity
*"It is emphatically *the province* and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is"* - Marshall

##### Supreme Court Decision Are Binding
- Supreme Court are the "Keepers of the Flame" of the Constitution
- Opinion written by all 9 justices.

<b>Case: <i>[Cooper v. Aaron](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-cooper-v-aaron.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Following Brown v. Board of Ed, Arkansas Governor refused to allow for desgregation. Case arose out of school board seeking postponement of desgregation. District court granted because of "chaos, bedlam, and turmoil" The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to all action of a state denying equal protection of the laws, whatever the agency of the state taking the action; moreover, the Constitution was the supreme law of the land.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Should the program for desegregation be postponed?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> No state legislator or executive or judicicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Constiution is the Supreme Law of the Land</li>
      <li>The Supreme Court's job is to say what the Law is</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's word is supreme</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's decisions are the Supreme Law of the Land.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Critique of Cooper distinguishing the Constitution v. What the Supreme Court says about the Constitution in its decisions.</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court Interpretations of the Constiution may not be overruled by an Act of Congress

Supreme Court is the final word on Constiutional interpretation

<b>Case: <i>[Dickerson v. United States](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-dickerson-v-united-states.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Denial of petitioner's motion to suppress was reversed, since Miranda had announced a constitutional rule that could not be superseded legislatively, and the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. Miranda being a Constituional decision cannot be overruled by an act of Congress.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> May Miranda, being a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Miranda and its progeny in the Supreme Court govern the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court reversed, finding that Miranda was a constitutional decision of the court, and therefore could not be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress. Further, following the principles of stare decisis, the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. The court held that Miranda and its progeny governed the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court over the Executive Branch

Judiciary set its own limits on the executive branch. Only has jurisdiction over executive agents in certain situations.
Big bark but no bite? Presidents will obey orders of court but generally talk a big game.

- Jefferson: *"Co-ordinate branches should be checks on each other, but for the Legislative & Executive in their spheres would make the judiciary a despotic branch"*
- Jackson: *"The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges, and on that point the President is independent of both."*
- Lincoln
- Roosevelt

#### 1.4.4 Political Restraints on the Supreme Court

##### 1. Judicial Selection: The Nomination and Confirmation Process
<details>

<ul>
  <li>Justices nominated by the President but Article 2 provides that the appointment will not be effective unless the President obtains the *"Advice and Consent of the Senate"*</li>
  <li>Prior to new deal era, Senate only rejected on grounds of inompetence or defects in character or temperment.</li>
  <li>People elect the President and the Senate, ergo they can help guide judicial appointments through indirect control</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### 2. Impeachment: Justices appointed to the court *"to hold their Offices during good Behaviour"* (Article 3)

<details>
<ul>
  <li>Presumed to confer life tenure</li>
  <li>May be removed from office on Impeachment for and "Conviction of Treason, Bribery or other High Crimes & Misdemeanors" (Article 2)</li>
  <li>Ideological disagreement with a sitting Justice is not a proper ground for impeachment.</li>
</ul>
</details>

##### 3. Structural Interference: Congress sets the size of and budge for the Court.
  - Executive Court Packing
  - Justice salaries cannot be diminished during their Continuance in Office (Article 3)
  - Potential source of political checking power

##### 4. Jurisdiction-Stripping
  - Congress has the power to make "exceptions" to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. (Article 3)

##### 5. Constitutional Amendment
  - Article 5 permits amendment of almost every provision (Article 5)
  - 2 Methods for initiating the amendment process:
    1. Congress, by a ***2/3rds*** vote may propose amendments for ratification by ***3/4ths*** of the states
    2. OR ***2/3rds*** of the states may apply to Congress to call a constitutional convention for "Proposing Amendments"
    - Amendments to overturn specific Supreme Court rulings have been ratified only 4 times since founding.
      - **(11th, 14th, 16th, 26th)**

#### 1.4.5 Political Questions & The Political Thicket (Limits)
*"Questions, in their nature political, or which are, by the Constitution and laws, submitted to the executive can never be made in this court"* - Marshall

##### Limits on Court:
  - "A case or controvery ***(must)*** arises under the Constituion"
  - Limits on Political Questions that the Court can hear
  - Will not do advisory opinions
  - Will not do cases where parties have no standing
  - Will not do cases that are too old or too soon
  - Will not do cases that are moot

#### Political Question Doctrine:

***The Supreme Court does not resolve political questions.***
Those questions are resolved through the political process.
1. That some matters are committed to the unreviewable discretion of the political branches, AND
  - Constitutional interpretation
2. That some otherwise legal questions ought to be left to the other branches as a matter of prudence.
  - Judicial Discretion

  <li><b>Overview:</b> Voters' complaint against state officers and election officials alleging that a state statute arbitrarily appointed representatives without any logical or rational formula presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, residents of several counties, filed a complaint against defendants, state officers and election officials, alleging that a state statute arbitrarily and capriciously appointed representatives without reference to any logical or rational formula and that it deprived them of the equal protection of the laws in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the District Court may declare a malapportionment legislature unconstitutional without raising a political question.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> A federal court cannot pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because it is irreconcilable with the United States Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed and remanded, holding that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which plaintiffs were entitled to a trial and a decision. The right that plaintiffs asserted was within the reach of judicial protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>

#### 2.1.2 Sovereignty in the Federal System

#### Case: *[McCulloch v. Maryland](Link)*

- Recognizes enumerated powers but also acknowledges implied powers.


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The state had no power, by taxation or otherwise, to burden the Bank of the United States because to do so would be repugnant to the supremacy of the laws enacted by Congress.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The state of Maryland sued McCulloch to recover certain penalties under the act of the legislature of Maryland, which imposed a tax on all banks in the state of Maryland not chartered by the Maryland legislature. McCulloch, a cashier at the Bank of the United States, had issued notes that were not issued on stamped paper in the manner prescribed by the state act. The county court found for the State, and the court of appeals affirmed. The cause was brought, by writ of error, to the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Act.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the said act of the General Assembly of Maryland constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The sound construction of the Constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed the holding that the act to incorporate the Bank of the United States was a law made in pursuance of the Constitution. Moreover, the Court held that the law imposing a tax on the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional and void because the states had no power to burden the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Government is acknowledged by all to be one of <b>enumerated powers.</b> The principle, that it can exercise only the powers granted to it, is now universally admitted. </li>
        <li>Marshall takes a broad view of Congress's implied powers in order to hold that Congress did have the power to charter a national bank,</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Based on the **Necessary and Proper Clause**</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Marshall also emphasized the **broad and general** nature of the document</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is *a constitution we are expounding*</li>
            <li>**It is intended to endure for ages to come and to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs**</li>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
- Part 1: Does the US Constitution allow the federal government to establish a bank?
 - The X Amendment thus provides no basis for concluding that the States possess reserved power to add qualifcations to those that are fixed in the Constitution.
   - No explicit power to create a bank
 - Creation of a bank is not a **bold usurpation**
 - Consitution a document for the people or the states
   - If states:
     - Inclined toward giving power to states
   - If People:
     - States are not preferred over the states.
   - Court finds for people, "We the people"
 - Creation of bank is not within its authoirty specifically
 - But notion of implied powers that are explained by necessary &
   - Necessary:
   - Ample means ability to act, means to carry out an end.
     - Raise an army - implied acts to carry out the means to that act
   - Proper:
 - Limiting Principle
   - **"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the consitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the consitution, are constitutional.**"
- Part 2: Whether the State of Maryland may, without violating the Constitution, tax that branch?
 - Supremecy Clause - Federal law is supreme so long as it is within its jurisdiction.
 - Power to tax and regulate = the power to destroy
- Limits on Federal Government - **4 Limits**
 - **Pretext**
   - Power they do have to justify a power they dont have
 - **Prohibited**
 - **Plainly Adapted**
   - Means must be plainly adapted to the ends
 - **Proper**
   - Within the power of the government and not to assume a great and substantial power

#### Reserved Powers States v. Federal Government
#### Case: *[U.S Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> State's legislative attempt to impose term limits upon eligible candidates for Congress, limiting candidates to three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate, violated the U.S. Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The people of Arkansas voted to amend the state constitution to impose term limits upon the individuals it elected to Congress. Ark. Const. amend. LXXIII limited persons seeking office in the House of Representatives to three terms and in the Senate to two terms. Respondent challenged the amendment and the trial court held that it was unconstitutional. The state supreme court upheld that ruling stating that states have no authority to change, add to, diminish the requirements of the Qualifications Clauses, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 2, Art. I, § 3, cl. 7. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the amendment unconstitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power to add qualifications is not within the original powers of the states, and thus is not reserved to the states by the U.S. Const. amend. X. Even if states possessed some original power in this area, the framers intended the Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress, and that the framers thereby divested states of any power to add qualifications.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The US Supreme Court upheld the lower court rulings because any changes with respect to term limits must be made, not by legislation, but rather through the amendment procedures set forth in the U.S. Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>

- **Class Discussion**
- Cannot add state requirements on federal positons unless by amendment
- Silence != Consent to act by States
- Majority
  - States have no reserved powers over the composition or operation of the federal government because power may not be reserved over what does not yet exist.
    - Big Bang Theory - Once the founding occurred, states only enjoyed thsoe powers over the federal government that the Consitution delegates to them. - Justice Kennedy
- Dissent
  - States have all powers, including powers with respect to activities of the federal government, **except those the Consitution withholds from them** either directly or by necessary implication
  - The USC is **simply silent on the question and where the USC is silent it raises no bar to action by the States or the People.**
  - Disagrees with the notion that the only powers reserved to the States are those that the States enjoyed before the framing.

#### *McCulloch & US Term Limits*
- Look at the structure of Consitution and examine the duel sovereignty of states v. federal government.
- Rights enumerated to the Federal Government
- States rights reserved to them v. intent of the Constituion to the federal government.

#### Tenth Amendment
- Should be read in conjunction with the Ninth Amendment (Enumeration of rights in the Constitution or lack thereof doesnt disparage those rights of the people)
- US Federal Government has enumerated rights outlined by the Constitution.
  - All other rights are reserved to the states.

#### Necessary & Proper Clause
- “The Congress shall have Power . . . To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.”
  - Jefferson: *The House that Jack Built*
    - Loose interpretation = power to do anything
    - Justifications can lead to anything that is not explicitly spelled out in Constitution.

    - States cannot push around federal government because federal law reigns supreme.


#### Case: *[U.S v. Comstock](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-united-states-v-comstock-664160383.aspx)*
- Involuntary civil commitment of sexual dangerous inmates
  - Necessary & Proper allowing for the need for the government to hold custody over prisoners and protect population from prisoners.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In November and December 2006, the Government instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the five respondents in this case. Three of the five had previously pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child pornography, and a fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor. With respect to each of them, the Government claimed that the respondent was about to be released from federal prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to others. During that same time period, the Government instituted similar proceedings against the fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial. Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil-commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, criminal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the Sixthand Eighth Amendments. They also claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution, including those granted by the Commerce Clauseand the Necessary and Proper Clause. The district court granted respondent inmates' motion to dismiss finding that in enacting § 4248, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal. Certiorari was granted on the request of the U.S.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Congress exceed its powers granted to it by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution when it enacted the statute?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> 18 U.S.C.S. § 4248 is reasonably adapted to Congress' power to act as a responsible federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement constitutionally enumerated authority). Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them to have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct, 18 U.S.C.S. § 4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high danger to the public if released. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Fourth Circuit's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The Court held that Section 4248 was a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related mental-health statutes that had existed for many decades, aside from its focus on sexually dangerous persons. The desire to address the specific challenges identified with mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoners, taken together with U.S. responsibilities as a federal custodian with the constitutional power to act to protect communities from the danger its prisoners could pose, satisfied a rational means review. Powers granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause were, by definition, not powers "reserved to the States" under U.S. Const. amend. X, and, § 4248 even required accommodation of state interests. Section 4248 was not too sweeping in scope. From the implied power to punish, the federal civil-commitment power was inferred.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>


- Necessary & Proper
  - Congress has broad authority to enact federal legislation that is **convenient** or **useful** or **conducive** to the authority's beneficial exercise.
  - **5 Part Test for Necessary & Proper:**
    1. Look to see whether statute constitutes a means that is **rationally related** to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power.
    2. **Modest addition** to a set of federal prison related mental health statutes in place since 1855 and historically been deemed okay.
    3. Federal Government is the **custodian** of its prisoners and has the consitutional power **to act in order to protect nearby and other communities from the danger** federal prisoners may pose.
    4. Statute properly **accounts for state interests**, not impoaching on state power
    5. The links between §4248 and an enumerated Article 1 power are not too attenuated.
  - Taken together the statute is a necessary and proper means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others.
- **Class Discussion**
  - No explicit indication where Constitution grants Congress power over Civil issues regarding Mental Sexual Predators.
  - 7-2 Decision demonstrates the hesitation of some to extend power through Necessary & Proper.
  - Allusion to warnings by Jefferson "The House that Jack Built"
  - Justice Kennedy **concurres** in judgement but disagrees with reasoning and desires **a tougher test**
    - Tangible link to an enumerated power
  - Justice Alito concurring in judgement
  - Dissent
    - Thomas & Scalia = Dangerously close to "police powers" which is reserved to states not to Federal Government

## 3.0 The Commerce Power and Its Federalism Based Limits
- Article 1 § 8 granted Congress the power to:
  - Taxes
  - Borrow Money
  - Regulate Commerce with Foreign Nations, and among the Several States, and with the Indian Tribes.
    - Textualist: Provides power for "trade" regulation
- Central purpose to suppress the "interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States"
- Goal to help end hostile state restrictions, retalitory trade regulations, and protective tariffs on imports from other states (Prisonner's Dilemma)...

#### Prisonner’s Dilemmas
1. State economies face a classic prisoner’s dilemma, or race to the bottom: on their own, states will be better off if they cooperate in economic policy, but each has a stronger incentive to defect. So if state A passes a child labor law, its production costs will rise, and state B will gain an economic advantage—but both states would benefit more if they both passes child labor laws.
2. One counterargument is that this is not a true prisoner’s dilemma because states may not agree that child labor laws are best for their citizens.
3. The federal government can provide the necessary centralized coordination to solve this dilemma.

### 3.1 Commerce Power Before the New Deal
- Marshall gave an expansive interpretation to the Commerce Clause in early 19th century.
  - NY legislature granted Livingston and Fulton, exclusive right to operate steamboats in NY waters.

#### Case: *[Gibbons v. Ogden](Link)*
- Commerce is more than just buying and selling
- Among the states includes commerce within the states
- Power to regulate commerce = power to do anything that is not prohibited by the Constitution.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' to navigate steamboats in waters of the United States, and the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the state was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A state act gave an exclusive right to certain individuals to use steam navigation in all the waters of New York for 30 years from 1808. An injunction was issued restraining defendants from navigating steamboats in the waters within the state because of this exclusive privilege, which defendants violated. Defendants contended that the privilege violated an act of Congress which regulated the licensing of ships and vessels in the coasting trade and fisheries and was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The state court found in favor of the plaintiff, and defendants appealed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the waters of the state valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>
    In regulating commerce with foreign nations, the power of Congress does not stop at the jurisdictional lines of the several states. The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, is that of the whole United States. Because Congress has the power to regulate commerce, that power must be exercised whenever the subject exists. If a foreign voyage may commence or terminate at a port within a state, then the power of Congress may be exercised within a state.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed, finding that the act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' vessels to navigate the waters of the United States. The law of the state of New York, prohibiting the vessels from navigating the waters of the state, was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    - Commerce undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is intercourse.
    - The Commerce power is the power to regulate, that is to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Commerce (PLUS) Defined
    - Navigation v. Trade (Buying and Selling)
    - Marshall: Navigation is included in commerce and has been understood to be included in commerce since the commencement of the government.
  - "Among" Defined
    - Power: Among between the states fall under the power of Congress
    - Limit: The completely **internal commerce of a state**, then may be considered as reserved for the state itself
  - The power to regulate is whatever Congress says it is
    - Acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution.

#### Judicial Limits on the Commerce Power
- 4 Principal Judicial Approaches
  1. **Direct v. Indirect Test**
    - *United States v. E.C. Knight Co.* (Sugar Trust Case)
      - Whether the regulated activity had a **direct** or **indirect** effect on interstate commerce
      - "Manufacturing" **does not** extend to regulation under the Commerce Clause
      - Regulation of commerce applies to the subjects of commerce and not to matters of internal police.
    - The manufacturing affects the commerce *indirectly* not directly, ergo Congress cannot regulate.
  2. **The "Substantial Economic Effects" Test**
    - *Houston, East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States* (Shrevport Rate Case)
    - Emphasizing the practical physical or economic effects of the regulated intrastate activities on interstate commerce.
      - Railroad Regulation: Authority to regulate **intrastate** rail rates that **discriminated** against interstate railroad traffic. (Prisoner's Dilemma)
      - Necessarily embraces the right to control their operations in all matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic and that affects more than 1 state.
  3. **The Stream of Commerce test**
    - *Swift & Co. v. United States*
      - Price fixing meat dealers
        - When cattle are sent for price fixing by meat dealers in one state, with the expectation that they will end their transit, after purchase in anothe, and when in effect they do so with only....
    - Local activities could be regulated by Congress because they could be viewed as themselves "in" commerce or as an integral part of the "current of commerce".
  4. **National "Police" Regulation**
    - Balance against pretext
    - *Champion v. Ames* (Lottery Case)
      - Prohibiting the import, mailing, or interstate transport of lottery tickets under the Commerce Clause
      - Sets the groundwork for police power
        - *Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States (Preserved Eggs)
          - Allowing the seizure of food that contained a "deleterious ingredient"
        - *Hoke v. United States (Interstate shipment of women)
          - Upheld the Mann act against transportation of women for immoral purposes.
          - Jack Johnson prosecution over sexual behavior



#### Limits on the Police Power of the Commerce Clause

#### Case: *[Hammer v. Dagenhart](Link)*
- The power to prohibit commerce depends on the harmful nature of the prohibited trade. Lotteries, for instance, are a “widespread pestilence” and therefore fall within Congress’s regulatory authority. Champion. But child labor does not. Moreover, Congress does not have the authority to prevent unfair competition between states.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A federal act, which prevented interstate commerce in the products of child labor, was unconstitutional because the act exceeded congress' authority under the Commerce Clause and invaded the states' reserved powers.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Congress enacted the Act of Sept. 1, 1916, which prevented interstate commerce in the products of child labor. Appellee father filed a bill to enjoin the enforcement of the Act, and the district court granted the bill and declared the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court upheld the district court's judgment, holding that the Act attempted the federal government's regulation of a matter that was purely local.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the contested legislation beyond the scope of authority of Congress?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The production of goods and the mining of coal are not considered commerce, and are therefore not under Congressional power to regulate. **The regulation of production is a local power reserved to States and is Constitutionally protected by the Tenth Amendment**. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that although there should be limitations upon the right to employ children in mines and factories in the interest of their own and the public's welfare, such regulation was reserved for the states. The grant of power to Congress over the subject of interstate commerce was to enable it to regulate such commerce, and not to give it authority to control the States in their exercise of the police power over local trade and manufacture.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Key question: “Is it within the authority of Congress in regulating commerce among the States to prohibit the transportation in interstate commerce of manufactured goods” produced with child labor.</li>
        <li>The government (Hammer, the DA for the Western District of North Carolina) argued that Congress was within its Commerce Clause authority. The government argued that the Commerce Clause automatically gives Congress the power to prohibit interstate trade of “ordiary commodities.” The Court disagreed, holding that the power to prohibit depends on “the character of the particular subjects dealt with.” For instance, in Champion, Congress’s authority rested on the harmful effects of lotteries. But “this element is wanting in the present case.”</li>
        <li>The government argued further that regulation was necessary to prevent states that allowed child labor to gain unfair trade advantages over states with child labor restrictions. The Court held that Congress has no power “to require the States to exercise their police power so as to prevent possible unfair competition.” Under any other result, “all freedom of commerce will be at an end, and the power of the States over local matters may be eliminated and thus our system of government be practically destroyed.”</li>
      </ul>

  - Pretext issue
    - Regulation of interstate commerce to regulate child labor.
  - Counter to the Court's previous rulings on ability to regulate "commerce"

  - Dissent:
    - Holmes
      - Interstate commerce is under the pervue of Congress.
      - Up to Congress to decide the reasons behind laws not the Courts

#### Case: *[NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.](Link)*
- The National Labor Relations Act prohibited employers “from engaging in unfair labor practices affecting commerce.
  - Jones & Laughlin was accused of violating the act by interfering with employees’ organizing and collective bargaining rights.
  - The Court held that Jones & Laughlin’s activities would have an indirect but significant impact on commerce:
    - "Although activities may be intrastate in character when separately considered, if they have such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control.”

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> National Labor Relations Board's order requiring employer to cease and desist from unfair labor practices was within its competency, and the National Labor Relations Act was a valid exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The National Labor Relations Board sought their enforcement of an order to employer, which was engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel, to cease and desist from unfair labor practices, to offer reinstatement to 10 employees at one of its plants who were discharged for union activity, to make good their losses in pay, and to post notices. The lower court denied its petition. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. The case was elevated on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the National Labor Relations Act authorized by Congress to regulate interstate commerce?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress to protect interstate commence is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it. Although activities may be intrastate in character, if they have a substantial relation to interstate commerce and their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court ruled that the National Labor Relations Act was a proper exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce, that employees had a right to self-organization, and that discrimination and coercion to prevent exercise of this right was a proper subject for condemnation by legislative authority. The court further ruled that the Act applied to respondent's employees who were engaged exclusively in production because intrastate activities that were closely connected to interstate commerce were subject to regulation by Congress.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The court reversed the district court's judgment, which had quashed the indictment against appellee on the grounds that the Fair Labor Act of 1938 was unconstitutional, because the restriction on the production of goods for commerce was a permissible exercise of the power under the Commerce Clause.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Fair Labor Standards Act set up a comprehensive legislative scheme for preventing the shipment in interstate commerce of certain products and commodities produced in the United States under labor conditions as respects wages and hours which fail to conform to standards set up by the Act. A lumber manufacturer was charged with violation of § 15(a)(1), (2), and (5) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Act). He sought to quash the indictment on the ground that the Act was unconstitutional. The District Court quashed the indictment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the Congress have constitutional power to prohibit the shipment in interstate commerce of lumber manufactured by employees?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress, having by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.S. § 201 et seq., adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the district court's judgment, which had quashed the indictment against appellee on the grounds that the Fair Labor Act of 1938 was unconstitutional, because the restriction on the production of goods for commerce was a permissible exercise of the power under the Commerce Clause, The court ruled that the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause was plenary to exclude any article from interstate commerce subject only to the specific prohibitions of the Constitution. Further, Congress, having by the Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which did not conform to the specified labor standards, could choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involved control of intrastate activities.</li>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Part 1 (prohibition of shipment of proscribed goods in interstate commerce under § 15(a)(1)):
    - “ . . . the only question arising under the commerce clause with respect to such shipments is whether Congress has the constitutional power to prohibit them.”
    - The government argued that Congress acted “under the guise of regulation of interstate commerce.” But its real aim was to regulate hours and wages.
    - Held: Congress’s freedom to exercise its commerce clause powers do not depend whether “its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states.” Or: Congress is free to exercise police power via the commerce clause as long as the commerce clause exercise is valid on its own.
    - **Hammer v. Dagenhart, which held that Congress’s commerce clause powers were limited to regulation of things with “some harmful or deleterious property,” is now overruled.**
    - 10th Amendment is a mere truism
  - Part 2 (validity of the wage and hour requirements under §§ 15(a)(2), 6, and 7):
    - Darby’s employees were not themselves engaged in interstate commerce. The question was whether employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce were within the reach of Congress’s regulatory power.
    - Reason 1: Congress intended the act not only to prevent transportation of the prohibited product, **but** also to “stop the initial step toward **tranportation**, **production** with the purpose of so transporting it. ”Such regulation was within Congress’s power.
      - Automatically regulate the production to protect against the shipment interstate.
    - Reason 2: Congress also appropriately exercised its commerce clause power in coordinating economic activity between the states by limiting “a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has in effect condemned as “unfair.”


#### Case: *[Wickard v. Filburn](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-wickard-v-filburn.aspx)*
- The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 mandated maximum allotments of wheat for farmers. Filburn was accused of violating the act by growing wheat for personal use in excess of the allotment.


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Decision that enjoined enforcement of Agricultural Adjustment Act amendment as to wheat marketing quota was reversed because penalties for agriculture department programs did not violate due process and were not unconstitutional.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Pending a referendum vote of farmers upon wheat quotas proclaimed by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, the Secretary made a radio address in which he advocated approval of the quotas and called attention to the recent enactment by Congress of the amendatory act, later approved May 26, 1941. Appellee farmer filed a complaint against appellants to enjoin enforcement against himself of the marketing penalty imposed by amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (Act) for violating the quotas set forth in the law. The Appellee farmer only used the produced wheat for personal use and local consumption. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can Congress regulate intrastate activity under its commerce clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress over interstate commerce is plenary and complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution. It follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. Hence the reach of that power extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> It is well established by decisions of this Court that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices. One of the primary purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat, and to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market and, if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce. The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon. This record leaves us in no doubt that Congress may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown, if wholly outside the scheme of regulation, would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices.</li>

    - If everyone produced personal wheat as Filburn did, it would have a substantial impact on the interstate wheat market. Therefore, personal wheat production was within Congress’s regulatory power under the commerce clause.
    - Decision: “ . . . even if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce . . .
    - The act in question was meant both to regulate the amount of wheat on the market and “the extent . . . to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs.”
    - This was the same argument that justified the insurance mandate in the Affordable Care Act.

#### Post-Hammer
- The Darby court moved away from the Hammer world in which Congress could only regulate items it saw as “noxious‘in themselves’”
- Does Darby mean that Congress is free to regulate interstate commerce for noneconomic reasons? Or does it mean that courts should not try to discern Congress’s motives as long as the regulation is a valid exercise of its commerce clause power?
- Darby and Wickard, both unanimous, might suggest that Congress enjoyed unlimited powers to regulate the national economy. But both cases involved issues of economic competition where only Congress could solve the coordination problem between states. States may have wanted to implement similar economic regulation but couldn’t because of the prisoner’s dilemma.

- Commerce Clause covers private hotels
  - Evidence of the burdens that discrimination by race or color places upon interstate commerce.
  - Inhibits interstate travel

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> a Georgia motel challenged Title II. The Court unanimously upheld the statute, holding that the motel “stood readily accessible to interstate highways, advertised in various national media, and served a clientele 75 percent of which came from out of state.”367 Congress can enact moral regulation on the basis of its Commerce Clause power.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A motel owner-operator, which discriminated in the renting of its rooms on the basis of race, sought review of a judgment by attacking the constitutionality of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Section § 202 of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 affirmatively declares that all persons shall be entitled to be free, at any establishment or place, from discrimination or segregation of any kind on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin, if such discrimination or segregation is or purports to be required by any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, or order of a State or any agency or political subdivision thereof. § 203 of the Act prohibits the withholding or denial, etc., of any right or privilege secured by §§ 201, § 202 or the intimidation, threatening or coercion of any person with the purpose of interfering with any such right or the punishing, etc., of any person for exercising or attempting to exercise any such right. The district court upheld the constitutionality of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and and enjoined the motel owner-operator from discriminating against Negroes on account of race or color. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the Civil Rights Act was a proper exercise of the commerce power and Congress was within its power to prohibit racial discrimination by motels serving travelers, however local their operations appeared. Affirming the judgment, the Court held that the power of Congress over interstate commerce extended to those intrastate activities that so affected interstate commerce or the exercise of Congressional power over it to make regulation of them an appropriate means to exercise its power over interstate commerce. Further, the power of Congress to promote interstate commerce also included the power to regulate the local incidents thereof, including local activities in both the state of origin and destination, which might have a substantial and harmful effect upon that commerce.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Loan sharking conviction was properly affirmed as Consumer Credit Protection Act was a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause powers; finding intrastate extortionate loans directly affected interstate commerce sufficiently sustained Act.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> For his extortionate credit transactions whereby he used the threat of violence as a method of collection, petitioner was convicted for "loan sharking" pursuant to Title II of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (Act), 18 U.S.C.S. § 891 et seq. Petitioner sought review of his conviction, contending that the Act as construed and applied to him was an unconstitutional exercise by Congress of its powers under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the regulation of “loan sharking” constitutes a permissible exercise by Congress of its powers under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Title II of the Consumer Credit Protection Act is within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause to control activities affecting interstate commerce and Congress' findings are adequate to support its conclusion that loan sharks who use extortionate means to collect payments on loans are in a class largely controlled by organized crime with a substantially adverse effect on interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court ruled that Congress' regulation of the credit transactions was supported by its findings. Such that, while the credit transactions, which were exorbitant, were purely intrastate; they directly affected interstate and foreign commerce, and that there was a connection between local "loan sharks" and interstate crime. Consequently, the Act was a valid exercise of Congress' prerogative under the Commerce Clause, as the regulation of the class designated those who in engage in these kinds of credit transactions in intrastate activities, which affected interstate commerce, was a reasonable means for Congress to use to attain a reasonable end in regulating interstate commerce.</li>

### Contemporary Commerce Power

#### Case: *[United States v. Lopez](Link)*

- Police Power of the Commerce Clause
- - <span style="color:red">**Restriction of Commerce Clause**</span>
  - Gun Control Legislation
  - The Gun-Free School Zones Act criminalized possession of guns in school zones. Lopez, a high school student, was caught with a gun at school. He challenged **the act as beyond the scope of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.**

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Gun-Free School Zones Act was invalid because it did not regulate an activity arising out of or connected with a commercial transaction that substantially affected interstate commerce, and thus, was beyond Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A 12th-grade student was charged with the knowing possession of a firearm at a school zone in violation of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which prohibits any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone (defined as in, or on the grounds of, a public, parochial, or private school or within a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of such a school). The trial court convicted the student and concluded that the Act was a constitutional exercise of Congress' power to regulate activities in and affecting commerce, and that the business of elementary, middle, and high schools affects interstate commerce. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed claiming that the Act exceeded the power of Congress to legislate under the commerce clause. The case was elevated by writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did Congress exceed its power to legislate under the Commerce Clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.  Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the GFSZA is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with "commerce" or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms. The GFSZA is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained as a regulation of activity that arises out of or is connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.</li>

- Opinions:
  - Justice Rehnquist - Majority:
    - **TOOLBOX**: Earlier cases (Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, Wickard) established Congress’s authority to enact social legislation under its Commerce Clause Authority. They allowed Congress to: **
      - (1) regulate activity that uses the channels of interstate commerce,
      - (2) protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and
      - (3) regulate activities with a substantial relation to interstate commerce. The first two categories were irrelevant in this case. Only the third is at issue.
    - The government argued that the statute affects interstate commerce because:
      - guns lead to costly violent crime,
      - because gun violence reduces travel and thus impedes commerce,
      - and because gun violence harms education which in turn harms economic productivity.
    - If the government’s theories were correct, would there be any areas of criminal law that the government could not regulate under the Commerce Clause? Any activity can be characterized as commercial. (House That Jack Built)
      - No regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce
      - No attempt to prohbit the interstate transporation of a commodity through the channels of commerce
      - No protection of an instrumentality of interstate commerce or a think in interstate commerce.
      - Guns are not "economic activity"
  - Justice Kennedy, concurring:
    - Federalism was one of the framers’ key values.
    - Broadening the Commerce Clause would disrupt the balance of power between state governments and the federal government.
    - Authority to regulate education lies with the states, and education is beyond commerce. States, however, are free to enact similar legislation.
  - Justice Thomas, concurring:
    - “ . . . the term ‘commerce’ denoted sale and/or transport rather than business generally.”
    - A more expansive reading of the meaning of “commerce” would render many other constitutional clauses superfluous.
    - “Taken together, these fundamental textual problems should, at the very least, convince us that the ‘substantial effects’ test should be reexamined . . .”
      - **Attempts to remove substantial effects test of "Commerce"**
  - Justice Stevens, dissenting:
    - The welfare of commerce depends on education.
    - “Guns are both articles of commerce and articles that can be used to restrain commerce. Their possession is the consequence, either directly or indirectly, of commercial activity.”
  - Justice Souter, dissenting:
    - 1900–1937: the Court invalidated federal social and economic legislation on the basis “highly formalistic notions of ‘commerce’”—e.g., Hammer v. Dagenhart (striking down legislation prohibiting commerce in goods manufactured with child labor).374 After 1937, the Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence expanded (Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, Wickard, and rational review)
    - The majority opinion here is“a backward glance at old pit falls...”
    - There is a close connection between education and commerce.
    - Congress’s Commerce Clause power is plenary. It doesn’t matter whether the power to regulate education lies with the states.
    - Congress’s findings on the effects of gun violence are not determinative.
  - Justice Breyer, dissenting:
    - Three principles of Commerce Clause interpretation:
      - Congress can regulate activity that significantly effects interstate commerce. Wickard.
      - Congress can regulate activity on the basis of its cumulative, not separate, effect. Wickard.
      - **Rational review is the proper standard.** - Prism of Congress's view of Commerce Clause
    - There is a substantial connection between this legislation and interstate commerce because gun violence has marked effects on education, and in turn, on commerce.
    - Upholding this act would not expand Congress’s Commerce Clause power.
    - The majority’s distinction between commercial and noncommercial activities is tenuous. And anyway, education has a clear impact on commerce. “ . . . Congress has often analyzed school expenditure as if it were a commercial investment . . .”

- Modification of Statute to change gun law.

- Commerce Clause & Gender Motivated Crimes

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Congress lacked the authority to enact a statute under the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment as the statute did not regulate an activity that substantially affected interstate commerce nor did it redress harm caused by the state.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner Brzonkala a student in Virginia Polytechnic Institute, filed suit, alleging, that she was raped by respondents while they were attending the university, and that this attack violated 42 U.S.C. § 13981, which provides a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Respondents moved to dismiss on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim and that § 13981's civil remedy is unconstitutional. Petitioner United States intervened to defend the section's constitutionality. In dismissing the complaint, the District Court held that it stated a claim against respondents, but that Congress lacked authority to enact § 13981 under either § 8 of the Commerce Clause or § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly identified as the sources of federal authority for § 13981. The en banc Fourth Circuit affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Are gender-motivated crimes within the authority of Congress to enact under the Commerce Clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence has identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, namely, those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed the decision of the lower court and held that gender-motivated crimes of violence were not considered economic activity, and therefore, the Commerce Clause did not vest Congress with the authority to enact a statute regulating such. Moreover, the court affirmed that the civil remedy contained in § 13981should be struck down as it was outside Congress's remedial power under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 5. The civil remedy was not found to be corrective in its character nor adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited state laws or proceedings of state officers. Instead, the subject statute redressed private discrimination and was outside Congress' power to enact.</li>

- Commerce Clause & Marijuana Legislation
- <span style="color:green">**Expansion of Commerce Clause**</span>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The regulation of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C.S. § 801 et seq., was squarely within Congress' commerce power under U.S. Const., art. I, § 8 because production of marijuana meant for home consumption had a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondents were California residents who suffered from a variety of serious medical conditions and had sought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compassionate Use Act. After an investigation, county officials concluded that one respondent's use of marijuana was entirely lawful under California law; nevertheless, federal agents seized and destroyed all six of her cannabis plants.Respondents brought an action against the Attorney General of the United States and the head of the DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> May Congress, under its commerce power, forbid the cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California law?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate activity within a state if the activity has a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the regulation of marijuana under the CSA was squarely within Congress' commerce power because production of marijuana meant for home consumption had a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market. Given the enforcement difficulties in distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, and concerns about diversion into illicit channels, the Court had no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Congress was acting well within its authority of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, § 8.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010's individual mandate provision, 26 U.S.C.S. § 5000A, requiring health insurance, was a valid tax under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396c could not constitutionally be applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds from states that did not comply with extended coverage requirements.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs challenged the individual mandate provision of 26 U.S.C.S. § 5000A, which imposed a “shared responsibility payment” on individuals who failed to maintain health insurance. The Court declined to uphold the individual mandate under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, or the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. However, it ruled that the mandate was a valid exercise of the taxing power under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. Factors such as the manner of collection indicated that the payment was a tax rather than a penalty. Plaintiffs appealed, also challenging the Act's Medicaid expansion provisions. ∆ Governemnt contends the failure to purchase insurance has a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce by creating a cost shifting problem. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can Medical Assistance Programs be constitutionally applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> n a split decision, the Court held that 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396c could not constitutionally be applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds from a state for failure to comply with the expanded coverage requirements. Under the commerce clause, The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. The remedy was to bar the federal government from imposing such a sanction, without striking down other portions of the Act.</li>

## The Tenth Amendment as an External Constraint on the Federal Commerce Power
- Court developing *external* restraints on the commerce power rooted in two textual sources
  1. Commerce power v. The 10th Amendment
    - "The Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

  2. Commerce power v. The 11th Amendment
    - "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosectued against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State"

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Citizens were not entitled to reinstatement of their action, which sought to enjoin state officials from moving the state capital, in part because fixing the location of the seat of government was within the State's power.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner citizens claimed that the Oklahoma Act, providing for the immediate location of the capital at Oklahoma City was void as repugnant to the Enabling Act of Congress of June 16, 1906, under which the State was admitted to the Union. Prior to the Oklahoma Act, the capital was located in another city. The citizens were owners of property interests in the former location of the capital. The state court rejected the citizens' challenges under the state constitution. On review, the Court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the state of Oklahoma have the power to locate its own seat of government?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The phrase "this Union" in U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3 was and is a union of States, equal in power, dignity and authority, each competent to exert that residuum of sovereignty not delegated to the United States by the Constitution itself.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The State, by virtue of its jurisdictional sovereignty as a state, was able to determine for its own people the proper location of the local seat of government. The power to locate its own seat of government, to change the same, and to appropriate its public money therefor, are essentially state powers beyond the control of Congress.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> The United States alleged that California was subject to the Safety Appliance Act as a transportation agency that acted as a common carrier. California argued that it was not subject to the Safety Appliance Act because it was engaged in performing a public function in its sovereign capacity. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> By engaging in interstate commerce by rail, a state subjects itself to the commerce power, and is liable for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, as are other carriers</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed and held that the only question was whether the exercise of California's power regarding the railroad, in whatever capacity, was in subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which had been granted specifically to the United States. The Court held that California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, subjected itself to the commerce power</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A State that bottled and sold its mineral water was subject to taxation under a federal statute because the State was engaged in an enterprise in which it sold water in competition with private sellers and in which Congress had decided to tax.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The United States brought suit pursuant to § 615(a)(5) of the 1932 Revenue Act to recover taxes assessed against the State for the sale of mineral waters. The State claimed immunity, arguing that it was engaging in a traditional and essential governmental function. The circuit court entered judgment for the United States, and the court of appeals affirmed. The case was elevated on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the government immune from paying taxes for the sale of mineral water?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To say that the States cannot be taxed for enterprises generally pursued, like the sale of mineral water, because it is somewhat connected with a State's conservation policy, is to invoke an irrelevance to the federal taxing power.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court found that the State was engaged in an enterprise in which the State sold mineral waters in competition with private waters, the sale of which Congress had found necessary to tap as a source of revenue for carrying on the national government. To say that the States could not be taxed for enterprises generally pursued, like the sale of mineral water, because it is somewhat connected with a State's conservation policy, was to invoke an irrelevance to the federal taxing power.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellants, various cities and states, commenced an action against appellee U.S. Secretary of Labor, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 203, on the ground that they were violative of the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I. Appellants maintained that the amendments, which eliminated a prior exemption from minimum wage and maximum hour requirements for public employees, intruded upon appellants' performance of essential government functions. Appellants challenged a district court decision dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>May Congress amend a law that would impair the states' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The U.S. Const. amend. X expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the states' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed. Congress could not exercise its power under the Commerce Clause to force its choices upon the states as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions were to be made.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A summary judgment was reversed in a claim of a municipally-owned transit system of exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act's wage and hour requirements because a transit system that was a traditional governmental function was subject to the Act.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA), a public mass-transit authority that is the major provider of transportation in the San Antonio, Texas, metropolitan area, filed an action in the United States District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the determination of the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor, its operations are constitutionally immune from the application of the minimum-wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). It relied on basis from National League of Cities v Usery (1976) 426 US 833, 49 L Ed 2d 245, 98 S Ct 2465, which held that the commerce clause does not empower Congress to enforce such requirements against the states in areas of traditional governmental functions. The District Court entered judgment for SAMTA, holding that municipal ownership and operation of a mass-transit system is a traditional governmental function and thus, under National League of Cities, is exempt from the obligations imposed by the FLSA. On appeal, appellant solicitor general argued that the court erred in extending immunity to appellee.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is SAMTA immune from minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The U.S. Supreme Court overrules the holding in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, 1067 (1938) against the states in areas of traditional governmental function.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that SAMTA was not immune from the minimum wage and overtime standards. The Court overturned the previous determination that the Commerce Clausedoes not empower Congress to enforce minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA because the provisions of FLSA did not destroy state sovereign immunity or violate any constitutional provision.></li>

  - Monetary Incentives
  - Access - Constituional
  - Take Title Sanctions - Debated
    - Violation of 10th amendment.


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The take title provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion, and thus violated the Tenth Amendment.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Congress, in an effort to combat a burgeoning radioactive waste disposal problem, passed the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985. The Act included monetary incentives, access incentives, and a take title provision, which offered states the option of taking title to and possession of low level radioactive waste generated within their borders and assuming liability for damages that waste generators suffer due to the states' tardiness. New York sued, claiming that the Act violated U.S. Const. amend. X.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> While Congress has substantial powers to govern the nation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to the states, the Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the states to govern according to Congress' instructions.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Affirmed in part and reversed in part; monetary and access incentives were permissible exercises of Congressional power under the commerce, tax, and spending clauses, but the take title provision violated U.S. Const. amend. X because it was coercive.</li>

#### Congressional Alternatives to Commandeering
- Spending power (Do all this and we will give you money.)
  - Under spending clause, Congress may condition the payment of relevant federal funds on a state's agreement to take title to waste if it has not already provided a waste disposal facility.
- Commerce Power
  - Under Commerce clause, Congress may pass federal legislation directly regulating the private producers of low level radioactive waste to limit their production.
  - Congress may impose a federal tax on interstate commerce and authorize the states to burden out of state commerce.
- Conditional Preemption (The Federal Government takes over regulation from states)
  - Congress may threaten to pass federal legislation under the Commerce Clause unless states choose to regulate according to federal standards.

  - State and Local Law Enforcement Officials

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Congressional enactment that temporarily required petitioners, state law enforcement officials, to participate in administration of a federal regulatory scheme for gun control unconstitutionally violated state autonomy.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In 1993, Congress amended the Gun Control Act of 1968 by enacting the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act ("Brady Act"). The Brady Act mandated the establishment of a national system for instant criminal background checks of proposed handgun transferees. The Brady Act amended a detailed federal scheme that governed distribution of firearms established by the Gun Control Act of 1968. Interim provisions directed state law enforcement officers to participate in administration of a federally enacted regulatory scheme. Petitioners, chief law enforcement officials (CLEO) of their respective counties, objected to being pressed into federal service and contended that congressional action that compelled state officers to execute federal laws was unconstitutional. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can Congress compel states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress cannot compel the states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the state's officers directly. The federal government may neither issue directives requiring the states to address particular problems, nor command the states' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Supreme Court agreed and held that the interim provisions violated constitutional principles of dual sovereignty and separation of powers. Congress could not compel states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Congress could not circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the state's officers directly. The Brady Act effectively transferred the executive branch's responsibility to administer federal laws to thousands of CLEOs in 50 states, who were left to implement the program without meaningful presidential control.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 was constitutional because Congress properly exercised its authority to regulate interstate commerce under Commerce Clause and did not run afoul of federalism principles.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The state and its attorney general sued the United States, alleging that the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA) violated U.S. Const. amends. X and XI. The district court granted summary judgment for the State and permanently enjoined the DPPA's enforcement against respondents. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the DPPA violate the Tenth Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 2721-2725 (1994 & Supp. III), is a proper exercise of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl.3</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held the DPPA was a proper exercise of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce because drivers' information was an article of commerce and its sale or release into the interstate stream of business was sufficient to support congressional regulation. The court rejected respondents' argument that the DPPA violated the principles of federalism contained in U.S. Const. amend. X since it did not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or regulations, and it did not require state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> The State could not be sued without its consent where a federal statute clearly intended to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity, but the United States Constitution did not grant Congress that power.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner tribe sued the State and its governor, alleging that they refused to enter into any negotiation for the inclusion of gaming activities in a tribal-state compact thereby violating 25 U.S.C.S. § 2710(d)(3). In their unsuccessful motion to dismiss the complaint, the State and the governor asserted that the suit violated the State's sovereign immunity under U.S. Const. amend. XI. The State and the governor took an interlocutory appeal of the decision that denied their motion to dismiss. The appellate court reversed, holding that amend. XI, barred the tribe's suit. On certiorari, the Court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did Congress "unequivocally" express its intent to abrogate the immunity?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> In order to determine whether Congress has abrogated the states' sovereign immunity, we ask two questions: first, whether Congress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity, and second, whether Congress has acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court affirmed because amend. XI, prohibited Congress from making the State capable of being sued in federal court. Notwithstanding Congress' clear intent to abrogate states' sovereign immunity through the gaming act, the Indian Commerce Clause did not grant Congress that power. </li>

Petitioners alleged that respondent violated the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. § 201 et seq., and they sought compensation and liquidated damages. The district court dismissed petitioners' action, and the court of appeals and the state supreme court affirmed. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Do the powers delegated to Congress under U.S. Const. Art. I include the power to subject nonconsenting states to private suits for damages in state courts?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Eleventh Amendment makes explicit reference to the states' immunity from suits commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the district court rendered the correct decision; hence, it affirmed the dismissal of the petitioners’ action. The Court reasoned that the powers delegated to Congress under U.S. Const. Art. I did not include the power to subject nonconsenting states to private suits for damages in state courts and that respondent did not consent to suits for overtime pay and liquidated damages under the FLSA.</li>

## The National Taxing and Spending Powers and Their Federalism-Based Limits
#### The Taxing Power as a Regulatory Device
- Article 1 § 8
  - Congress invoking the taxing power when commerce clause seems unusable

#### Case: *[Child Labor Tax Case - Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.](Link)*
- [Hammer v. Dagenhart](link), the Court held unconstitutional Congress's efforts to regulate child labor through exercise of the commerce power.
  - Congress enabled Child Labor Tax Law - imposing a federal excise tax

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Child Labor Tax was invalidated because it sought to regulate state child labor, an exclusive state function, through imposing a penalty on those such as a manufacturer who failed to act in accordance with Congress' wishes.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff incurred tax liability under the Child Labor Tax Law (Law), 40 Stat. 1057, 1138 (1919), by permitting a child to work in its factory. After paying the tax bill under protest, plaintiff brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Law and sought a tax refund. It is contended that the Law regulates employment of child labor which is an exclusively state function. The District Court struck the Child Labor Tax Law for being an invalid exercise of state function. Defendant appealed from the lower court's entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the Child Labor Tax Law unconstitutional for being an invalid exercise of state power?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Where a sovereign enacting a law has power to impose both tax and penalty the difference between revenue production and mere regulation may be immaterial, but not so when one sovereign can impose a tax only, and the power of regulation rests in another. Taxes are occasionally imposed in the discretion of the legislature on proper subjects with the primary motive of obtaining revenue from them and with the incidental motive of discouraging them by making their continuance onerous. They do not lose their character as taxes because of the incidental motive. There comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of regulation and punishment.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court on appeal affirmed, holding that the Law was an impermissible attempt to regulate employment of child labor, an exclusive state function reserved under U.S. Const. amend. X. The Court held that the Law was not an allowable federal government excise tax but rather a penalty enacted to coerce state citizens to act in accordance with Congress' views on child labor. The Law was not naturally and reasonably adapted to collection of a tax but an impermissible attempt to achieve a purpose solely within state power.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A decision that an excise tax on wagering was unconstitutional was improper because the tax was not arbitrary and was regulatory in nature.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The issue raised by this appeal is the constitutionality of the occupational tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1951, which levy a tax on persons engaged in the business of accepting wagers, and require such persons to register with the Collector of Internal Revenue. The unconstitutionality of the tax is asserted on two grounds. First, it is said that Congress, under the pretense of exercising its power to tax has attempted to penalize illegal intrastate gambling through the regulatory features of the Act (26 U. S. C. (Supp. V) § 3291) and has thus infringed the police power which is reserved to the states. Secondly, it is urged that the registration provisions of the tax violate the privilege against self-incrimination and are arbitrary and vague, contrary to the guarantees of the Fifth Amendment</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is a wagering tax an unconstitutional regulation of matters within the exclusive power of the states and does it violate the guarantee against self-incrimination of the Fifth Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Unless there are provisions extraneous to any tax need, courts are without authority to limit the exercise of the taxing power. The remedy for excessive taxation is in the hands of Congress, not the courts.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court found that the excise tax had a regulatory effect, produced revenue, and clearly defined the activities covered and excluded. The court also found that the registration requirements of the excise tax on wagering were not offensive. The court further found that the required data was directly and intimately related to the collection of the tax and were obviously supportable as in aid of a revenue purpose. The court also rejected the taxpayer's argument that the excise tax was a denial of the privilege against self-incrimination. The court determined that under the registration provisions of the excise tax, the taxpayer was not compelled to confess to acts already committed, he was merely informed by the statute that in order to engage in the business of wagering in the future he must fulfill certain conditions. A majority of the Supreme Court, in reversing the dismissal, held, in an opinion by Reed, J., that the wagering tax, since it produced revenue, was not an unconstitutional regulation of matters within the exclusive power of the states; did not violate the guarantee against self-incrimination of the Fifth Amendment, since it did not compel tax registrants to confess to acts already committed; and did not employ arbitrary classification or vague statutory definitions violative of due process.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A cotton tax imposed on receivers under the Agricultural Adjustment Act was an unconstitutional assertion of power by Congress and invaded the reserved rights of the states to regulate and control agricultural production.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the government claimed cotton taxes from respondent receivers and the receivers recommended that the claim be disallowed. The government argued that the Act was valid because Congress was authorized to appropriate and authorize spending for the "general welfare" under U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7, and that the Act was an effort to aid farmers during the great depression. The district court found the taxes valid and ordered them paid, but the United States Circuit Court of Appeals reversed on appeal. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the Agricultural Adjustment Act valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 confers upon the Congress power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States. The true construction of this clause undoubtedly is that the only thing granted is the power to tax for the purpose of providing funds for payment of the nation's debts and making provision for the general welfare.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that while the Act might have been within Congress' power if it fell within the ambit of the term "general welfare," the Court did not have to reach the question of the interpretation of that whether it did so because the Act was unconstitutional on other grounds. The Act was clearly designed to regulate agriculture by coercing a non-cooperating minority to a desired action with economic pressure. However, the power to regulate agriculture was not granted to Congress by the Constitution, but rather, was reserved to the States. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement, were possibly permissible means to an unconstitutional end. Thus, Congress had no power to enforce its commands on the farmer to the ends sought by the Act, and it could not indirectly accomplish those ends by taxing and spending to purchase compliance.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> The law the state challenged was intended to encourage states to raise their minimum drinking age to 21. In the event a state failed to raise its minimum drinking age to 21, appellee Secretary of Transportation was permitted to withhold a percentage of a state's federal highway funds. The state argued that congress, by enacting the law, impermissibly impaired its exclusive and constitutionally protected right to regulate the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The court stated that congress could have reasonably concluded that the problem of young adults drinking and driving was not a purely local or intrastate concern but rather is a concern of interstate and national proportions. </li>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A state law was upheld as constitutional because the constitutional grant to Congress of the power to regulate commerce did not deprive the states of the power to regulate pilots.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Pilots brought writs of error and sought to be exempted from the payment of half-pilotage fees, which they were required to pay pursuant to a state law that required certain ships to either receive a pilot or pay a fee. They contended that the state law contravened provisions of the Constitution. They also complained that the state law was repugnant to the provision of the Constitution that provided that Congress had the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found the state law constitutional and valid. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is a state regulation involving the regulation of pilots constitutional and valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The grant of a power to Congress, does not imply a prohibition on the states to exercise the same power. It is not the mere existence of such a power, but its exercise by Congress, which may be incompatible with the exercise of the same power by the states, and the states may legislate in the absence of congressional regulations. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court affirmed the finding that the state law was valid and not in conflict with any provisions of the Constitution. The Court found that the grant to Congress of the power to regulate commerce did not deprive the states of the power to regulate pilots. Although Congress was granted such power, nothing required that it should be exercised exclusively by Congress.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Statute permitting four categories of waste to enter state and excluding parties it had previous waste agreements with was unconstitutional because it was not a law directed at legitimate local concerns with incidental effects on interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, landfill operators, brought an action against defendants, state and department, arguing that N.J. Stat. Ann. 13:1I-10 was unconstitutional because it permitted four categories of waste to enter the state, and excluded plaintiffs. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and the lower appellate court reversed, finding that the statute advanced vital health and environmental objectives with no economic discrimination against interstate commerce. The Supreme Court reversed the lower appellate court's decision.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the statutory prohibition violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The statute was a protectionist measure and not a law directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental. The court concluded that no matter what defendant's ultimate purpose was, it could not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the state unless there was some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently. The court concluded that the contested statute both on its face and in its plain effect violated the principle of nondiscrimination because on its face, it imposed on out-of-state commercial interests the full burden of conserving the state's remaining landfill space.</li>

#### Case: *[Dean Milk Co. v. Madison](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A city ordinance prohibiting the sale of milk in the city unless it was pasteurized within five miles of the city was unconstitutional because it imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce and reasonable and adequate alternatives were available.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellant corporation, a milk distributor, was denied a license to sell its products within the city based upon the fact that the corporation's pasteurization plants were more than five miles away from the city, as mandated by a Wisconsin ordinance. Appellant brought a suit against the appellee city, represented by Health Commissioner of Madison, challenging the statute's constitutionality.  The Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed the constitutionality of the ordinances. On review, the Court reversed the decision of the lower court, vacated the lower court's judgment on the issue of the five-mile provision, and remanded the case for further proceedings with respect to the ordinance containing the 25-mile inspection provision.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the ordinance unjustifiably discriminate against interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A city cannot discriminate against interstate commerce, even in the exercise of its unquestioned power to protect the health and safety of its people, if reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, adequate to conserve legitimate local interests, are available.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court determined that, under the Commerce Clause, § 7.21 imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce because, in effect, the ordinance excluded from distribution in the city wholesale milk produced and pasteurized in an adjoining state. The Court found that the city had erected an economic barrier protecting a major local industry against competition from outside the state, plainly discriminating against interstate commerce. Furthermore, reasonable and adequate health standard alternatives were available. Accordingly, the Court held that § 7.21 violated the Commerce Clause. Because the state supreme court had found it unnecessary to pass on the validity of the separate 25-mile inspection limitation in Madison, Wis., Gen. Ordinances § 7.11 (1949), the Court remanded for further proceedings.</li>
