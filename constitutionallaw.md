### 1.4 Authority & Role of the Supreme Court

#### 1.4.1 The Power of Judicial Review

Does the Court have the final word in constitutional interpretation? **Both Congress and the Executive Branch** also interpret the Constitution, but whose say is final?

##### Historical Context of Judicial Review
1. Adams had issued and signed an order appointing Marbury a justice of the peace. Marshall, then Secretary of State, failed to deliver it before the end of the Adams administration. Jefferson and Madison, the new Secretary of State, refused to deliver it. Marbury sued in December 1801 to receive the commission.
2. The “peculiar delicacy” of the case was its contentious political context and the impact of the Court’s decision on the relations between the branches of government. Madison’s failure to appear in court resulted from the controversy.


<b>Case: <i>[Marbury v. Madison](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/c36871a6-f343-4439-92c2-c20a624e1549/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Even though an applicant had a legal right to his appointment as justice of the peace, he was not entitled to a mandamus because the act giving the U.S. Supreme Court authority to issue a mandamus to an officer violated the Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Did Marbury have a right to the commission?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> The commission was complete when the President signed it and the Secretary of State affixed the U.S. seal.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to the commission, did he have right to a legal remedy? When can courts review the executive’s actions?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> Acts “in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion . . . are only politically examinable” i.e., they are beyond judicial review. <b>BUT</b> when the act arises under a legal duty, “<b>and individual rights</b> depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . ”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The Rule of Law: <i>“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”</i> Compare to Louis XIV: “The State, it is I.”</li>
                <li>The question of whether an officer as an individual has a vested right in his appointment, and therefore whether the President can remove him at will, is for the courts. Therefore the courts can review Marbury’s dispute.</li>
                <li>Whether a right is vested is a question for the courts to decide and is not coferring <b>the political question doctrine</b>.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to a remedy, was it a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court? Can the Court enforce the remedy? Can the Court declare a statute to be unconstitutional? Why?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system, authorized the Supreme Court to issue mandamus to lower courts or officials. Madison was an official, so mandamus was unavailable only if the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
              <li>Marshall: "The Constitution granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in only two types of cases (those involving ambassadors, etc., and those in which a state is a party). The Constitution’s division of the Court’s jurisdiction between original and appellate meant that it did not intend to give Congress the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction.</li>
              <li>Congress therefore did not have the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction. <b>§13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</b></li>
              <li><b>Constitutional Supremacy</b>(LINK): the Supremacy Clause established the Constitution as the “supreme law of the land.” so verse the statute, the constitution holds power</li>
              <li><b>Judicial Review (LINK):</b> Limited government requires the Court to review the constitutionality of statutes. <b>“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</b></li>
            </ul>
      </ol>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Supreme Court's jurisdiction was given by statute. Interpretation of the statute allowed for jurisdiction but also brought it into conflict with the Constitution.</li>
        <li>Courts have the ability to judge cases that "arise under" the Constitution.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>Jefferson calls holding "dictum" because the case was dismissed. Not binding law.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

##### Theories of Judicial Review
1. Judicial interpretation: First or Last Word?
   - Is the court’s role mainly to legitimize the national government’s actions or to invalidate them?
2. Judicial supremacy and judicial finality
   - Do other branches have to accept Court decisions as authoritative (judicial supremacy)? Does the court get the last word, or do other branches also have the authority to interpret the Constitution (judicial finality/exclusivity)?
3. Departmentalism:
  - Each Branch of government can interpret the constitution.

##### Frameworks of Beneath the Theories of Judicial Review
1. Functionalism
  - The Court’s actions contribute to maintaining a certain kind of American polity. Judiciary represents, "We The People" as a check on Congress and the Executive Branch.
2. Originalism and Textualism
 - The Court acts on the framers’ intent or on its reading of the text itself.



#### 1.4.2 Supreme Court Authority to Review State Court Judgements
Vertical Power over the states.
"The Constituion bristols with limits over states..."

###### Judiciary oversees interactions within the federal government and between the federal government and the states.
  - The Court rejects the dual soveriengty idea and replaces it with interlocking oversight.



<b>Case: <i>[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/b6a39380-672b-4b93-8fdb-f7bb6d7d8c42/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> The Supreme Court of the United States had appellate power over a final judgement from a state court of appeals because the matter concerned an issue arising under a treaty of the United States.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff appealed from the Court of Appeals of Virginia which found for defendant in plaintiff's action of ejectment, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed. The court of appeals refused to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court because it determined that the appellate power of the Supreme Court did not extend to the state court of appeals. The case was once again brought to the Supreme Court on writ of error.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the Supreme Court of the United States has appellate jurisdiction over the state court of appeals.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial power of the United States, except in courts ordained and established by itself; and if in any of the cases enumerated in the constitution, the state courts did not then possess jurisdiction, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (admitting that it could act on state courts) could not reach those cases, and, consequently, the injunction of the constitution, that the judicial power "shall be vested," would be disobeyed. It would seem, therefore, to follow, that congress are bound to create some inferior courts, in which to vest all that jurisdiction which, under the constitution, is exclusively vested in the United States, and of which the supreme court cannot take original cognizance. They might establish one or more inferior courts; they might parcel out the jurisdiction among such courts, from time to time, at their own pleasure. But the whole judicial power of the United States should be, at all times, vested either in an original or appellate form, in some courts created under its authority.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Appellate jurisdiction is over the case not the court. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over cases that involve any of the enumerated issues (SMJ) outlined in Article 3 of the Constitution. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> The Court’s power to review state court decisions and the constitutionality of state court decisions is well established. See §25 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789</li>

</ul>

</details>



#### 1.4.2.1 Supreme Court Review of State Criminal Cases
*"The judicial power extends to all cases arising under the constitution or a law of the United States, whoever may be the parties"* - Marshall

Power granted by §25 of the 1789 Judiciary act

<b>Case: <i>[Cohens v. Virginia](Link)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Criminal charges decided on the merits against ∆ selling DC lottery tickets in violation of Virgina Law. Supreme Court had jurisdiction to review state judgements.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether the Supreme Court can hear Criminal Cases from the State and Local Governments.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> State judges are more susceptible to state legislatures. State itself was a party to the case, as a result Supreme Court has jurisdiction under the Constitution.</li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

#### 1.4.3 Judicial Exclusivity
*"It is emphatically *the province* and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is"* - Marshall

##### Supreme Court Decision Are Binding
- Supreme Court are the "Keepers of the Flame" of the Constitution
- Opinion written by all 9 justices.

<b>Case: <i>[Cooper v. Aaron](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-cooper-v-aaron.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Following Brown v. Board of Ed, Arkansas Governor refused to allow for desgregation. Case arose out of school board seeking postponement of desgregation. District court granted because of "chaos, bedlam, and turmoil" The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to all action of a state denying equal protection of the laws, whatever the agency of the state taking the action; moreover, the Constitution was the supreme law of the land.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Should the program for desegregation be postponed?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> No state legislator or executive or judicicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Constiution is the Supreme Law of the Land</li>
      <li>The Supreme Court's job is to say what the Law is</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's word is supreme</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's decisions are the Supreme Law of the Land.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Critique of Cooper distinguishing the Constitution v. What the Supreme Court says about the Constitution in its decisions.</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court Interpretations of the Constiution may not be overruled by an Act of Congress

Supreme Court is the final word on Constiutional interpretation

<b>Case: <i>[Dickerson v. United States](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-dickerson-v-united-states.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Denial of petitioner's motion to suppress was reversed, since Miranda had announced a constitutional rule that could not be superseded legislatively, and the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. Miranda being a Constituional decision cannot be overruled by an act of Congress.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> May Miranda, being a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Miranda and its progeny in the Supreme Court govern the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court reversed, finding that Miranda was a constitutional decision of the court, and therefore could not be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress. Further, following the principles of stare decisis, the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. The court held that Miranda and its progeny governed the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court over the Executive Branch

Judiciary set its own limits on the executive branch. Only has jurisdiction over executive agents in certain situations.
Big bark but no bite? Presidents will obey orders of court but generally talk a big game.

- Jefferson: *"Co-ordinate branches should be checks on each other, but for the Legislative & Executive in their spheres would make the judiciary a despotic branch"*
- Jackson: *"The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges, and on that point the President is independent of both."*
- Lincoln
- Roosevelt

#### 1.4.4 Political Restraints on the Supreme Court

##### 1. Judicial Selection: The Nomination and Confirmation Process
<details>

<ul>
  <li>Justices nominated by the President but Article 2 provides that the appointment will not be effective unless the President obtains the *"Advice and Consent of the Senate"*</li>
  <li>Prior to new deal era, Senate only rejected on grounds of inompetence or defects in character or temperment.</li>
  <li>People elect the President and the Senate, ergo they can help guide judicial appointments through indirect control</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### 2. Impeachment: Justices appointed to the court *"to hold their Offices during good Behaviour"* (Article 3)

<details>
<ul>
  <li>Presumed to confer life tenure</li>
  <li>May be removed from office on Impeachment for and "Conviction of Treason, Bribery or other High Crimes & Misdemeanors" (Article 2)</li>
  <li>Ideological disagreement with a sitting Justice is not a proper ground for impeachment.</li>
</ul>
</details>

##### 3. Structural Interference: Congress sets the size of and budge for the Court.
  - Executive Court Packing
  - Justice salaries cannot be diminished during their Continuance in Office (Article 3)
  - Potential source of political checking power

##### 4. Jurisdiction-Stripping
  - Congress has the power to make "exceptions" to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. (Article 3)

##### 5. Constitutional Amendment
  - Article 5 permits amendment of almost every provision (Article 5)
  - 2 Methods for initiating the amendment process:
    1. Congress, by a ***2/3rds*** vote may propose amendments for ratification by ***3/4ths*** of the states
    2. OR ***2/3rds*** of the states may apply to Congress to call a constitutional convention for "Proposing Amendments"
    - Amendments to overturn specific Supreme Court rulings have been ratified only 4 times since founding.
      - **(11th, 14th, 16th, 26th)**

#### 1.4.5 Political Questions & The Political Thicket (Limits)
*"Questions, in their nature political, or which are, by the Constitution and laws, submitted to the executive can never be made in this court"* - Marshall

##### Limits on Court:
  - "A case or controvery ***(must)*** arises under the Constituion"
  - Limits on Political Questions that the Court can hear
  - Will not do advisory opinions
  - Will not do cases where parties have no standing
  - Will not do cases that are too old or too soon
  - Will not do cases that are moot

#### Political Question Doctrine:

***The Supreme Court does not resolve political questions.***
Those questions are resolved through the political process.
1. That some matters are committed to the unreviewable discretion of the political branches, AND
  - Constitutional interpretation
2. That some otherwise legal questions ought to be left to the other branches as a matter of prudence.
  - Judicial Discretion

  <li><b>Overview:</b> Voters' complaint against state officers and election officials alleging that a state statute arbitrarily appointed representatives without any logical or rational formula presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, residents of several counties, filed a complaint against defendants, state officers and election officials, alleging that a state statute arbitrarily and capriciously appointed representatives without reference to any logical or rational formula and that it deprived them of the equal protection of the laws in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the District Court may declare a malapportionment legislature unconstitutional without raising a political question.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> A federal court cannot pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because it is irreconcilable with the United States Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed and remanded, holding that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which plaintiffs were entitled to a trial and a decision. The right that plaintiffs asserted was within the reach of judicial protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>

#### 2.1.2 Sovereignty in the Federal System

#### Case: *[McCulloch v. Maryland](Link)*

- Recognizes enumerated powers but also acknowledges implied powers.


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The state had no power, by taxation or otherwise, to burden the Bank of the United States because to do so would be repugnant to the supremacy of the laws enacted by Congress.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The state of Maryland sued McCulloch to recover certain penalties under the act of the legislature of Maryland, which imposed a tax on all banks in the state of Maryland not chartered by the Maryland legislature. McCulloch, a cashier at the Bank of the United States, had issued notes that were not issued on stamped paper in the manner prescribed by the state act. The county court found for the State, and the court of appeals affirmed. The cause was brought, by writ of error, to the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Act.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the said act of the General Assembly of Maryland constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The sound construction of the Constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed the holding that the act to incorporate the Bank of the United States was a law made in pursuance of the Constitution. Moreover, the Court held that the law imposing a tax on the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional and void because the states had no power to burden the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Government is acknowledged by all to be one of <b>enumerated powers.</b> The principle, that it can exercise only the powers granted to it, is now universally admitted. </li>
        <li>Marshall takes a broad view of Congress's implied powers in order to hold that Congress did have the power to charter a national bank,</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Based on the **Necessary and Proper Clause**</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Marshall also emphasized the **broad and general** nature of the document</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is *a constitution we are expounding*</li>
            <li>**It is intended to endure for ages to come and to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs**</li>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
- Part 1: Does the US Constitution allow the federal government to establish a bank?
 - The X Amendment thus provides no basis for concluding that the States possess reserved power to add qualifcations to those that are fixed in the Constitution.
   - No explicit power to create a bank
 - Creation of a bank is not a **bold usurpation**
 - Consitution a document for the people or the states
   - If states:
     - Inclined toward giving power to states
   - If People:
     - States are not preferred over the states.
   - Court finds for people, "We the people"
 - Creation of bank is not within its authoirty specifically
 - But notion of implied powers that are explained by necessary &
   - Necessary:
   - Ample means ability to act, means to carry out an end.
     - Raise an army - implied acts to carry out the means to that act
   - Proper:
 - Limiting Principle
   - **"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the consitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the consitution, are constitutional.**"
- Part 2: Whether the State of Maryland may, without violating the Constitution, tax that branch?
 - Supremecy Clause - Federal law is supreme so long as it is within its jurisdiction.
 - Power to tax and regulate = the power to destroy
- Limits on Federal Government - **4 Limits**
 - **Pretext**
   - Power they do have to justify a power they dont have
 - **Prohibited**
 - **Plainly Adapted**
   - Means must be plainly adapted to the ends
 - **Proper**
   - Within the power of the government and not to assume a great and substantial power

#### Reserved Powers States v. Federal Government
#### Case: *[U.S Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> State's legislative attempt to impose term limits upon eligible candidates for Congress, limiting candidates to three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate, violated the U.S. Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The people of Arkansas voted to amend the state constitution to impose term limits upon the individuals it elected to Congress. Ark. Const. amend. LXXIII limited persons seeking office in the House of Representatives to three terms and in the Senate to two terms. Respondent challenged the amendment and the trial court held that it was unconstitutional. The state supreme court upheld that ruling stating that states have no authority to change, add to, diminish the requirements of the Qualifications Clauses, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 2, Art. I, § 3, cl. 7. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the amendment unconstitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power to add qualifications is not within the original powers of the states, and thus is not reserved to the states by the U.S. Const. amend. X. Even if states possessed some original power in this area, the framers intended the Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress, and that the framers thereby divested states of any power to add qualifications.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The US Supreme Court upheld the lower court rulings because any changes with respect to term limits must be made, not by legislation, but rather through the amendment procedures set forth in the U.S. Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>

- **Class Discussion**
- Cannot add state requirements on federal positons unless by amendment
- Silence != Consent to act by States
- Majority
  - States have no reserved powers over the composition or operation of the federal government because power may not be reserved over what does not yet exist.
    - Big Bang Theory - Once the founding occurred, states only enjoyed thsoe powers over the federal government that the Consitution delegates to them. - Justice Kennedy
- Dissent
  - States have all powers, including powers with respect to activities of the federal government, **except those the Consitution withholds from them** either directly or by necessary implication
  - The USC is **simply silent on the question and where the USC is silent it raises no bar to action by the States or the People.**
  - Disagrees with the notion that the only powers reserved to the States are those that the States enjoyed before the framing.

#### *McCulloch & US Term Limits*
- Look at the structure of Consitution and examine the duel sovereignty of states v. federal government.
- Rights enumerated to the Federal Government
- States rights reserved to them v. intent of the Constituion to the federal government.

#### Tenth Amendment
- Should be read in conjunction with the Ninth Amendment (Enumeration of rights in the Constitution or lack thereof doesnt disparage those rights of the people)
- US Federal Government has enumerated rights outlined by the Constitution.
  - All other rights are reserved to the states.

#### Necessary & Proper Clause
- “The Congress shall have Power . . . To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.”
  - Jefferson: *The House that Jack Built*
    - Loose interpretation = power to do anything
    - Justifications can lead to anything that is not explicitly spelled out in Constitution.

    - States cannot push around federal government because federal law reigns supreme.


#### Case: *[U.S v. Comstock](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-united-states-v-comstock-664160383.aspx)*
- Involuntary civil commitment of sexual dangerous inmates
  - Necessary & Proper allowing for the need for the government to hold custody over prisoners and protect population from prisoners.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In November and December 2006, the Government instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the five respondents in this case. Three of the five had previously pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child pornography, and a fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor. With respect to each of them, the Government claimed that the respondent was about to be released from federal prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to others. During that same time period, the Government instituted similar proceedings against the fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial. Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil-commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, criminal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the Sixthand Eighth Amendments. They also claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution, including those granted by the Commerce Clauseand the Necessary and Proper Clause. The district court granted respondent inmates' motion to dismiss finding that in enacting § 4248, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal. Certiorari was granted on the request of the U.S.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Congress exceed its powers granted to it by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution when it enacted the statute?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> 18 U.S.C.S. § 4248 is reasonably adapted to Congress' power to act as a responsible federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement constitutionally enumerated authority). Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them to have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct, 18 U.S.C.S. § 4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high danger to the public if released. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Fourth Circuit's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The Court held that Section 4248 was a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related mental-health statutes that had existed for many decades, aside from its focus on sexually dangerous persons. The desire to address the specific challenges identified with mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoners, taken together with U.S. responsibilities as a federal custodian with the constitutional power to act to protect communities from the danger its prisoners could pose, satisfied a rational means review. Powers granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause were, by definition, not powers "reserved to the States" under U.S. Const. amend. X, and, § 4248 even required accommodation of state interests. Section 4248 was not too sweeping in scope. From the implied power to punish, the federal civil-commitment power was inferred.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>


- Necessary & Proper
  - Congress has broad authority to enact federal legislation that is **convenient** or **useful** or **conducive** to the authority's beneficial exercise.
  - **5 Part Test for Necessary & Proper:**
    1. Look to see whether statute constitutes a means that is **rationally related** to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power.
    2. **Modest addition** to a set of federal prison related mental health statutes in place since 1855 and historically been deemed okay.
    3. Federal Government is the **custodian** of its prisoners and has the consitutional power **to act in order to protect nearby and other communities from the danger** federal prisoners may pose.
    4. Statute properly **accounts for state interests**, not impoaching on state power
    5. The links between §4248 and an enumerated Article 1 power are not too attenuated.
  - Taken together the statute is a necessary and proper means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others.
- **Class Discussion**
  - No explicit indication where Constitution grants Congress power over Civil issues regarding Mental Sexual Predators.
  - 7-2 Decision demonstrates the hesitation of some to extend power through Necessary & Proper.
  - Allusion to warnings by Jefferson "The House that Jack Built"
  - Justice Kennedy **concurres** in judgement but disagrees with reasoning and desires **a tougher test**
    - Tangible link to an enumerated power
  - Justice Alito concurring in judgement
  - Dissent
    - Thomas & Scalia = Dangerously close to "police powers" which is reserved to states not to Federal Government

## 3.0 The Commerce Power and Its Federalism Based Limits
- Article 1 § 8 granted Congress the power to:
  - Taxes
  - Borrow Money
  - Regulate Commerce with Foreign Nations, and among the Several States, and with the Indian Tribes.
    - Textualist: Provides power for "trade" regulation
- Central purpose to suppress the "interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States"
- Goal to help end hostile state restrictions, retalitory trade regulations, and protective tariffs on imports from other states (Prisonner's Dilemma)...

#### Prisonner’s Dilemmas
1. State economies face a classic prisoner’s dilemma, or race to the bottom: on their own, states will be better off if they cooperate in economic policy, but each has a stronger incentive to defect. So if state A passes a child labor law, its production costs will rise, and state B will gain an economic advantage—but both states would benefit more if they both passes child labor laws.
2. One counterargument is that this is not a true prisoner’s dilemma because states may not agree that child labor laws are best for their citizens.
3. The federal government can provide the necessary centralized coordination to solve this dilemma.

### 3.1 Commerce Power Before the New Deal
- Marshall gave an expansive interpretation to the Commerce Clause in early 19th century.
  - NY legislature granted Livingston and Fulton, exclusive right to operate steamboats in NY waters.

#### Case: *[Gibbons v. Ogden](Link)*
- Commerce is more than just buying and selling
- Among the states includes commerce within the states
- Power to regulate commerce = power to do anything that is not prohibited by the Constitution.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' to navigate steamboats in waters of the United States, and the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the state was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A state act gave an exclusive right to certain individuals to use steam navigation in all the waters of New York for 30 years from 1808. An injunction was issued restraining defendants from navigating steamboats in the waters within the state because of this exclusive privilege, which defendants violated. Defendants contended that the privilege violated an act of Congress which regulated the licensing of ships and vessels in the coasting trade and fisheries and was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The state court found in favor of the plaintiff, and defendants appealed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the waters of the state valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>
    In regulating commerce with foreign nations, the power of Congress does not stop at the jurisdictional lines of the several states. The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, is that of the whole United States. Because Congress has the power to regulate commerce, that power must be exercised whenever the subject exists. If a foreign voyage may commence or terminate at a port within a state, then the power of Congress may be exercised within a state.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed, finding that the act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' vessels to navigate the waters of the United States. The law of the state of New York, prohibiting the vessels from navigating the waters of the state, was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    - Commerce undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is intercourse.
    - The Commerce power is the power to regulate, that is to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Commerce (PLUS) Defined
    - Navigation v. Trade (Buying and Selling)
    - Marshall: Navigation is included in commerce and has been understood to be included in commerce since the commencement of the government.
  - "Among" Defined
    - Power: Among between the states fall under the power of Congress
    - Limit: The completely **internal commerce of a state**, then may be considered as reserved for the state itself
  - The power to regulate is whatever Congress says it is
    - Acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution.

#### Judicial Limits on the Commerce Power
- 4 Principal Judicial Approaches
  1. **Direct v. Indirect Test**
    - *United States v. E.C. Knight Co.* (Sugar Trust Case)
      - Whether the regulated activity had a **direct** or **indirect** effect on interstate commerce
      - "Manufacturing" **does not** extend to regulation under the Commerce Clause
      - Regulation of commerce applies to the subjects of commerce and not to matters of internal police.
    - The manufacturing affects the commerce *indirectly* not directly, ergo Congress cannot regulate.
  2. **The "Substantial Economic Effects" Test**
    - *Houston, East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States* (Shrevport Rate Case)
    - Emphasizing the practical physical or economic effects of the regulated intrastate activities on interstate commerce.
      - Railroad Regulation: Authority to regulate **intrastate** rail rates that **discriminated** against interstate railroad traffic. (Prisoner's Dilemma)
      - Necessarily embraces the right to control their operations in all matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic and that affects more than 1 state.
  3. **The Stream of Commerce test**
    - *Swift & Co. v. United States*
      - Price fixing meat dealers
        - When cattle are sent for price fixing by meat dealers in one state, with the expectation that they will end their transit, after purchase in anothe, and when in effect they do so with only....
    - Local activities could be regulated by Congress because they could be viewed as themselves "in" commerce or as an integral part of the "current of commerce".
  4. **National "Police" Regulation**
    - Balance against pretext
    - *Champion v. Ames* (Lottery Case)
      - Prohibiting the import, mailing, or interstate transport of lottery tickets under the Commerce Clause
      - Sets the groundwork for police power
        - *Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States (Preserved Eggs)
          - Allowing the seizure of food that contained a "deleterious ingredient"
        - *Hoke v. United States (Interstate shipment of women)
          - Upheld the Mann act against transportation of women for immoral purposes.
          - Jack Johnson prosecution over sexual behavior



#### Limits on the Police Power of the Commerce Clause

#### Case: *[Hammer v. Dagenhart](Link)*
- The power to prohibit commerce depends on the harmful nature of the prohibited trade. Lotteries, for instance, are a “widespread pestilence” and therefore fall within Congress’s regulatory authority. Champion. But child labor does not. Moreover, Congress does not have the authority to prevent unfair competition between states.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A federal act, which prevented interstate commerce in the products of child labor, was unconstitutional because the act exceeded congress' authority under the Commerce Clause and invaded the states' reserved powers.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Congress enacted the Act of Sept. 1, 1916, which prevented interstate commerce in the products of child labor. Appellee father filed a bill to enjoin the enforcement of the Act, and the district court granted the bill and declared the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court upheld the district court's judgment, holding that the Act attempted the federal government's regulation of a matter that was purely local.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the contested legislation beyond the scope of authority of Congress?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The production of goods and the mining of coal are not considered commerce, and are therefore not under Congressional power to regulate. **The regulation of production is a local power reserved to States and is Constitutionally protected by the Tenth Amendment**. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that although there should be limitations upon the right to employ children in mines and factories in the interest of their own and the public's welfare, such regulation was reserved for the states. The grant of power to Congress over the subject of interstate commerce was to enable it to regulate such commerce, and not to give it authority to control the States in their exercise of the police power over local trade and manufacture.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Key question: “Is it within the authority of Congress in regulating commerce among the States to prohibit the transportation in interstate commerce of manufactured goods” produced with child labor.</li>
        <li>The government (Hammer, the DA for the Western District of North Carolina) argued that Congress was within its Commerce Clause authority. The government argued that the Commerce Clause automatically gives Congress the power to prohibit interstate trade of “ordiary commodities.” The Court disagreed, holding that the power to prohibit depends on “the character of the particular subjects dealt with.” For instance, in Champion, Congress’s authority rested on the harmful effects of lotteries. But “this element is wanting in the present case.”</li>
        <li>The government argued further that regulation was necessary to prevent states that allowed child labor to gain unfair trade advantages over states with child labor restrictions. The Court held that Congress has no power “to require the States to exercise their police power so as to prevent possible unfair competition.” Under any other result, “all freedom of commerce will be at an end, and the power of the States over local matters may be eliminated and thus our system of government be practically destroyed.”</li>
      </ul>

  - Pretext issue
    - Regulation of interstate commerce to regulate child labor.
  - Counter to the Court's previous rulings on ability to regulate "commerce"

  - Dissent:
    - Holmes
      - Interstate commerce is under the pervue of Congress.
      - Up to Congress to decide the reasons behind laws not the Courts

#### Case: *[NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.](Link)*
- The National Labor Relations Act prohibited employers “from engaging in unfair labor practices affecting commerce.
  - Jones & Laughlin was accused of violating the act by interfering with employees’ organizing and collective bargaining rights.
  - The Court held that Jones & Laughlin’s activities would have an indirect but significant impact on commerce:
    - "Although activities may be intrastate in character when separately considered, if they have such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control.”

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> National Labor Relations Board's order requiring employer to cease and desist from unfair labor practices was within its competency, and the National Labor Relations Act was a valid exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The National Labor Relations Board sought their enforcement of an order to employer, which was engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel, to cease and desist from unfair labor practices, to offer reinstatement to 10 employees at one of its plants who were discharged for union activity, to make good their losses in pay, and to post notices. The lower court denied its petition. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. The case was elevated on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the National Labor Relations Act authorized by Congress to regulate interstate commerce?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress to protect interstate commence is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it. Although activities may be intrastate in character, if they have a substantial relation to interstate commerce and their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court ruled that the National Labor Relations Act was a proper exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce, that employees had a right to self-organization, and that discrimination and coercion to prevent exercise of this right was a proper subject for condemnation by legislative authority. The court further ruled that the Act applied to respondent's employees who were engaged exclusively in production because intrastate activities that were closely connected to interstate commerce were subject to regulation by Congress.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The court reversed the district court's judgment, which had quashed the indictment against appellee on the grounds that the Fair Labor Act of 1938 was unconstitutional, because the restriction on the production of goods for commerce was a permissible exercise of the power under the Commerce Clause.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Fair Labor Standards Act set up a comprehensive legislative scheme for preventing the shipment in interstate commerce of certain products and commodities produced in the United States under labor conditions as respects wages and hours which fail to conform to standards set up by the Act. A lumber manufacturer was charged with violation of § 15(a)(1), (2), and (5) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Act). He sought to quash the indictment on the ground that the Act was unconstitutional. The District Court quashed the indictment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the Congress have constitutional power to prohibit the shipment in interstate commerce of lumber manufactured by employees?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress, having by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.S. § 201 et seq., adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the district court's judgment, which had quashed the indictment against appellee on the grounds that the Fair Labor Act of 1938 was unconstitutional, because the restriction on the production of goods for commerce was a permissible exercise of the power under the Commerce Clause, The court ruled that the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause was plenary to exclude any article from interstate commerce subject only to the specific prohibitions of the Constitution. Further, Congress, having by the Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which did not conform to the specified labor standards, could choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involved control of intrastate activities.</li>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Part 1 (prohibition of shipment of proscribed goods in interstate commerce under § 15(a)(1)):
    - “ . . . the only question arising under the commerce clause with respect to such shipments is whether Congress has the constitutional power to prohibit them.”
    - The government argued that Congress acted “under the guise of regulation of interstate commerce.” But its real aim was to regulate hours and wages.
    - Held: Congress’s freedom to exercise its commerce clause powers do not depend whether “its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states.” Or: Congress is free to exercise police power via the commerce clause as long as the commerce clause exercise is valid on its own.
    - **Hammer v. Dagenhart, which held that Congress’s commerce clause powers were limited to regulation of things with “some harmful or deleterious property,” is now overruled.**
    - 10th Amendment is a mere truism
  - Part 2 (validity of the wage and hour requirements under §§ 15(a)(2), 6, and 7):
    - Darby’s employees were not themselves engaged in interstate commerce. The question was whether employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce were within the reach of Congress’s regulatory power.
    - Reason 1: Congress intended the act not only to prevent transportation of the prohibited product, **but** also to “stop the initial step toward **tranportation**, **production** with the purpose of so transporting it. ”Such regulation was within Congress’s power.
      - Automatically regulate the production to protect against the shipment interstate.
    - Reason 2: Congress also appropriately exercised its commerce clause power in coordinating economic activity between the states by limiting “a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has in effect condemned as “unfair.”


#### Case: *[Wickard v. Filburn](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-wickard-v-filburn.aspx)*
- The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 mandated maximum allotments of wheat for farmers. Filburn was accused of violating the act by growing wheat for personal use in excess of the allotment.


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Decision that enjoined enforcement of Agricultural Adjustment Act amendment as to wheat marketing quota was reversed because penalties for agriculture department programs did not violate due process and were not unconstitutional.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Pending a referendum vote of farmers upon wheat quotas proclaimed by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, the Secretary made a radio address in which he advocated approval of the quotas and called attention to the recent enactment by Congress of the amendatory act, later approved May 26, 1941. Appellee farmer filed a complaint against appellants to enjoin enforcement against himself of the marketing penalty imposed by amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (Act) for violating the quotas set forth in the law. The Appellee farmer only used the produced wheat for personal use and local consumption. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can Congress regulate intrastate activity under its commerce clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress over interstate commerce is plenary and complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution. It follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. Hence the reach of that power extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> It is well established by decisions of this Court that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices. One of the primary purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat, and to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market and, if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce. The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon. This record leaves us in no doubt that Congress may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown, if wholly outside the scheme of regulation, would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices.</li>

    - If everyone produced personal wheat as Filburn did, it would have a substantial impact on the interstate wheat market. Therefore, personal wheat production was within Congress’s regulatory power under the commerce clause.
    - Decision: “ . . . even if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce . . .
    - The act in question was meant both to regulate the amount of wheat on the market and “the extent . . . to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs.”
    - This was the same argument that justified the insurance mandate in the Affordable Care Act.

#### Post-Hammer
- The Darby court moved away from the Hammer world in which Congress could only regulate items it saw as “noxious‘in themselves’”
- Does Darby mean that Congress is free to regulate interstate commerce for noneconomic reasons? Or does it mean that courts should not try to discern Congress’s motives as long as the regulation is a valid exercise of its commerce clause power?
- Darby and Wickard, both unanimous, might suggest that Congress enjoyed unlimited powers to regulate the national economy. But both cases involved issues of economic competition where only Congress could solve the coordination problem between states. States may have wanted to implement similar economic regulation but couldn’t because of the prisoner’s dilemma.

- Commerce Clause covers private hotels
  - Evidence of the burdens that discrimination by race or color places upon interstate commerce.
  - Inhibits interstate travel

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> a Georgia motel challenged Title II. The Court unanimously upheld the statute, holding that the motel “stood readily accessible to interstate highways, advertised in various national media, and served a clientele 75 percent of which came from out of state.”367 Congress can enact moral regulation on the basis of its Commerce Clause power.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A motel owner-operator, which discriminated in the renting of its rooms on the basis of race, sought review of a judgment by attacking the constitutionality of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Section § 202 of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 affirmatively declares that all persons shall be entitled to be free, at any establishment or place, from discrimination or segregation of any kind on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin, if such discrimination or segregation is or purports to be required by any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, or order of a State or any agency or political subdivision thereof. § 203 of the Act prohibits the withholding or denial, etc., of any right or privilege secured by §§ 201, § 202 or the intimidation, threatening or coercion of any person with the purpose of interfering with any such right or the punishing, etc., of any person for exercising or attempting to exercise any such right. The district court upheld the constitutionality of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and and enjoined the motel owner-operator from discriminating against Negroes on account of race or color. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the Civil Rights Act was a proper exercise of the commerce power and Congress was within its power to prohibit racial discrimination by motels serving travelers, however local their operations appeared. Affirming the judgment, the Court held that the power of Congress over interstate commerce extended to those intrastate activities that so affected interstate commerce or the exercise of Congressional power over it to make regulation of them an appropriate means to exercise its power over interstate commerce. Further, the power of Congress to promote interstate commerce also included the power to regulate the local incidents thereof, including local activities in both the state of origin and destination, which might have a substantial and harmful effect upon that commerce.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Loan sharking conviction was properly affirmed as Consumer Credit Protection Act was a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause powers; finding intrastate extortionate loans directly affected interstate commerce sufficiently sustained Act.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> For his extortionate credit transactions whereby he used the threat of violence as a method of collection, petitioner was convicted for "loan sharking" pursuant to Title II of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (Act), 18 U.S.C.S. § 891 et seq. Petitioner sought review of his conviction, contending that the Act as construed and applied to him was an unconstitutional exercise by Congress of its powers under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the regulation of “loan sharking” constitutes a permissible exercise by Congress of its powers under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Title II of the Consumer Credit Protection Act is within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause to control activities affecting interstate commerce and Congress' findings are adequate to support its conclusion that loan sharks who use extortionate means to collect payments on loans are in a class largely controlled by organized crime with a substantially adverse effect on interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court ruled that Congress' regulation of the credit transactions was supported by its findings. Such that, while the credit transactions, which were exorbitant, were purely intrastate; they directly affected interstate and foreign commerce, and that there was a connection between local "loan sharks" and interstate crime. Consequently, the Act was a valid exercise of Congress' prerogative under the Commerce Clause, as the regulation of the class designated those who in engage in these kinds of credit transactions in intrastate activities, which affected interstate commerce, was a reasonable means for Congress to use to attain a reasonable end in regulating interstate commerce.</li>

### Contemporary Commerce Power

#### Case: *[United States v. Lopez](Link)*

- Police Power of the Commerce Clause
- - <span style="color:red">**Restriction of Commerce Clause**</span>
  - Gun Control Legislation
  - The Gun-Free School Zones Act criminalized possession of guns in school zones. Lopez, a high school student, was caught with a gun at school. He challenged **the act as beyond the scope of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.**

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Gun-Free School Zones Act was invalid because it did not regulate an activity arising out of or connected with a commercial transaction that substantially affected interstate commerce, and thus, was beyond Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A 12th-grade student was charged with the knowing possession of a firearm at a school zone in violation of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which prohibits any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone (defined as in, or on the grounds of, a public, parochial, or private school or within a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of such a school). The trial court convicted the student and concluded that the Act was a constitutional exercise of Congress' power to regulate activities in and affecting commerce, and that the business of elementary, middle, and high schools affects interstate commerce. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed claiming that the Act exceeded the power of Congress to legislate under the commerce clause. The case was elevated by writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did Congress exceed its power to legislate under the Commerce Clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.  Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the GFSZA is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with "commerce" or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms. The GFSZA is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained as a regulation of activity that arises out of or is connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.</li>

- Opinions:
  - Justice Rehnquist - Majority:
    - **TOOLBOX**: Earlier cases (Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, Wickard) established Congress’s authority to enact social legislation under its Commerce Clause Authority. They allowed Congress to: **
      - (1) regulate activity that uses the channels of interstate commerce,
      - (2) protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and
      - (3) regulate activities with a substantial relation to interstate commerce. The first two categories were irrelevant in this case. Only the third is at issue.
    - The government argued that the statute affects interstate commerce because:
      - guns lead to costly violent crime,
      - because gun violence reduces travel and thus impedes commerce,
      - and because gun violence harms education which in turn harms economic productivity.
    - If the government’s theories were correct, would there be any areas of criminal law that the government could not regulate under the Commerce Clause? Any activity can be characterized as commercial. (House That Jack Built)
      - No regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce
      - No attempt to prohbit the interstate transporation of a commodity through the channels of commerce
      - No protection of an instrumentality of interstate commerce or a think in interstate commerce.
      - Guns are not "economic activity"
  - Justice Kennedy, concurring:
    - Federalism was one of the framers’ key values.
    - Broadening the Commerce Clause would disrupt the balance of power between state governments and the federal government.
    - Authority to regulate education lies with the states, and education is beyond commerce. States, however, are free to enact similar legislation.
  - Justice Thomas, concurring:
    - “ . . . the term ‘commerce’ denoted sale and/or transport rather than business generally.”
    - A more expansive reading of the meaning of “commerce” would render many other constitutional clauses superfluous.
    - “Taken together, these fundamental textual problems should, at the very least, convince us that the ‘substantial effects’ test should be reexamined . . .”
      - **Attempts to remove substantial effects test of "Commerce"**
  - Justice Stevens, dissenting:
    - The welfare of commerce depends on education.
    - “Guns are both articles of commerce and articles that can be used to restrain commerce. Their possession is the consequence, either directly or indirectly, of commercial activity.”
  - Justice Souter, dissenting:
    - 1900–1937: the Court invalidated federal social and economic legislation on the basis “highly formalistic notions of ‘commerce’”—e.g., Hammer v. Dagenhart (striking down legislation prohibiting commerce in goods manufactured with child labor).374 After 1937, the Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence expanded (Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, Wickard, and rational review)
    - The majority opinion here is“a backward glance at old pit falls...”
    - There is a close connection between education and commerce.
    - Congress’s Commerce Clause power is plenary. It doesn’t matter whether the power to regulate education lies with the states.
    - Congress’s findings on the effects of gun violence are not determinative.
  - Justice Breyer, dissenting:
    - Three principles of Commerce Clause interpretation:
      - Congress can regulate activity that significantly effects interstate commerce. Wickard.
      - Congress can regulate activity on the basis of its cumulative, not separate, effect. Wickard.
      - **Rational review is the proper standard.** - Prism of Congress's view of Commerce Clause
    - There is a substantial connection between this legislation and interstate commerce because gun violence has marked effects on education, and in turn, on commerce.
    - Upholding this act would not expand Congress’s Commerce Clause power.
    - The majority’s distinction between commercial and noncommercial activities is tenuous. And anyway, education has a clear impact on commerce. “ . . . Congress has often analyzed school expenditure as if it were a commercial investment . . .”

- Modification of Statute to change gun law.

- Commerce Clause & Gender Motivated Crimes

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Congress lacked the authority to enact a statute under the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment as the statute did not regulate an activity that substantially affected interstate commerce nor did it redress harm caused by the state.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner Brzonkala a student in Virginia Polytechnic Institute, filed suit, alleging, that she was raped by respondents while they were attending the university, and that this attack violated 42 U.S.C. § 13981, which provides a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Respondents moved to dismiss on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim and that § 13981's civil remedy is unconstitutional. Petitioner United States intervened to defend the section's constitutionality. In dismissing the complaint, the District Court held that it stated a claim against respondents, but that Congress lacked authority to enact § 13981 under either § 8 of the Commerce Clause or § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly identified as the sources of federal authority for § 13981. The en banc Fourth Circuit affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Are gender-motivated crimes within the authority of Congress to enact under the Commerce Clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence has identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, namely, those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed the decision of the lower court and held that gender-motivated crimes of violence were not considered economic activity, and therefore, the Commerce Clause did not vest Congress with the authority to enact a statute regulating such. Moreover, the court affirmed that the civil remedy contained in § 13981should be struck down as it was outside Congress's remedial power under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 5. The civil remedy was not found to be corrective in its character nor adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited state laws or proceedings of state officers. Instead, the subject statute redressed private discrimination and was outside Congress' power to enact.</li>

- Commerce Clause & Marijuana Legislation
- <span style="color:green">**Expansion of Commerce Clause**</span>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The regulation of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C.S. § 801 et seq., was squarely within Congress' commerce power under U.S. Const., art. I, § 8 because production of marijuana meant for home consumption had a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondents were California residents who suffered from a variety of serious medical conditions and had sought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compassionate Use Act. After an investigation, county officials concluded that one respondent's use of marijuana was entirely lawful under California law; nevertheless, federal agents seized and destroyed all six of her cannabis plants.Respondents brought an action against the Attorney General of the United States and the head of the DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> May Congress, under its commerce power, forbid the cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California law?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate activity within a state if the activity has a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the regulation of marijuana under the CSA was squarely within Congress' commerce power because production of marijuana meant for home consumption had a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market. Given the enforcement difficulties in distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, and concerns about diversion into illicit channels, the Court had no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Congress was acting well within its authority of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, § 8.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010's individual mandate provision, 26 U.S.C.S. § 5000A, requiring health insurance, was a valid tax under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396c could not constitutionally be applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds from states that did not comply with extended coverage requirements.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs challenged the individual mandate provision of 26 U.S.C.S. § 5000A, which imposed a “shared responsibility payment” on individuals who failed to maintain health insurance. The Court declined to uphold the individual mandate under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, or the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. However, it ruled that the mandate was a valid exercise of the taxing power under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. Factors such as the manner of collection indicated that the payment was a tax rather than a penalty. Plaintiffs appealed, also challenging the Act's Medicaid expansion provisions. ∆ Governemnt contends the failure to purchase insurance has a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce by creating a cost shifting problem. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can Medical Assistance Programs be constitutionally applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> n a split decision, the Court held that 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396c could not constitutionally be applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds from a state for failure to comply with the expanded coverage requirements. Under the commerce clause, The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. The remedy was to bar the federal government from imposing such a sanction, without striking down other portions of the Act.</li>

## The Tenth Amendment as an External Constraint on the Federal Commerce Power
- Court developing *external* restraints on the commerce power rooted in two textual sources
  1. Commerce power v. The 10th Amendment
    - "The Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

  2. Commerce power v. The 11th Amendment
    - "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosectued against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State"

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Citizens were not entitled to reinstatement of their action, which sought to enjoin state officials from moving the state capital, in part because fixing the location of the seat of government was within the State's power.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner citizens claimed that the Oklahoma Act, providing for the immediate location of the capital at Oklahoma City was void as repugnant to the Enabling Act of Congress of June 16, 1906, under which the State was admitted to the Union. Prior to the Oklahoma Act, the capital was located in another city. The citizens were owners of property interests in the former location of the capital. The state court rejected the citizens' challenges under the state constitution. On review, the Court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the state of Oklahoma have the power to locate its own seat of government?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The phrase "this Union" in U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3 was and is a union of States, equal in power, dignity and authority, each competent to exert that residuum of sovereignty not delegated to the United States by the Constitution itself.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The State, by virtue of its jurisdictional sovereignty as a state, was able to determine for its own people the proper location of the local seat of government. The power to locate its own seat of government, to change the same, and to appropriate its public money therefor, are essentially state powers beyond the control of Congress.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> The United States alleged that California was subject to the Safety Appliance Act as a transportation agency that acted as a common carrier. California argued that it was not subject to the Safety Appliance Act because it was engaged in performing a public function in its sovereign capacity. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> By engaging in interstate commerce by rail, a state subjects itself to the commerce power, and is liable for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, as are other carriers</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed and held that the only question was whether the exercise of California's power regarding the railroad, in whatever capacity, was in subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which had been granted specifically to the United States. The Court held that California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, subjected itself to the commerce power</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A State that bottled and sold its mineral water was subject to taxation under a federal statute because the State was engaged in an enterprise in which it sold water in competition with private sellers and in which Congress had decided to tax.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The United States brought suit pursuant to § 615(a)(5) of the 1932 Revenue Act to recover taxes assessed against the State for the sale of mineral waters. The State claimed immunity, arguing that it was engaging in a traditional and essential governmental function. The circuit court entered judgment for the United States, and the court of appeals affirmed. The case was elevated on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the government immune from paying taxes for the sale of mineral water?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To say that the States cannot be taxed for enterprises generally pursued, like the sale of mineral water, because it is somewhat connected with a State's conservation policy, is to invoke an irrelevance to the federal taxing power.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court found that the State was engaged in an enterprise in which the State sold mineral waters in competition with private waters, the sale of which Congress had found necessary to tap as a source of revenue for carrying on the national government. To say that the States could not be taxed for enterprises generally pursued, like the sale of mineral water, because it is somewhat connected with a State's conservation policy, was to invoke an irrelevance to the federal taxing power.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellants, various cities and states, commenced an action against appellee U.S. Secretary of Labor, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 203, on the ground that they were violative of the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I. Appellants maintained that the amendments, which eliminated a prior exemption from minimum wage and maximum hour requirements for public employees, intruded upon appellants' performance of essential government functions. Appellants challenged a district court decision dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>May Congress amend a law that would impair the states' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The U.S. Const. amend. X expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the states' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed. Congress could not exercise its power under the Commerce Clause to force its choices upon the states as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions were to be made.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A summary judgment was reversed in a claim of a municipally-owned transit system of exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act's wage and hour requirements because a transit system that was a traditional governmental function was subject to the Act.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA), a public mass-transit authority that is the major provider of transportation in the San Antonio, Texas, metropolitan area, filed an action in the United States District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the determination of the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor, its operations are constitutionally immune from the application of the minimum-wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). It relied on basis from National League of Cities v Usery (1976) 426 US 833, 49 L Ed 2d 245, 98 S Ct 2465, which held that the commerce clause does not empower Congress to enforce such requirements against the states in areas of traditional governmental functions. The District Court entered judgment for SAMTA, holding that municipal ownership and operation of a mass-transit system is a traditional governmental function and thus, under National League of Cities, is exempt from the obligations imposed by the FLSA. On appeal, appellant solicitor general argued that the court erred in extending immunity to appellee.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is SAMTA immune from minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The U.S. Supreme Court overrules the holding in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, 1067 (1938) against the states in areas of traditional governmental function.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that SAMTA was not immune from the minimum wage and overtime standards. The Court overturned the previous determination that the Commerce Clausedoes not empower Congress to enforce minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA because the provisions of FLSA did not destroy state sovereign immunity or violate any constitutional provision.></li>

  - Monetary Incentives
  - Access - Constituional
  - Take Title Sanctions - Debated
    - Violation of 10th amendment.


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The take title provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion, and thus violated the Tenth Amendment.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Congress, in an effort to combat a burgeoning radioactive waste disposal problem, passed the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985. The Act included monetary incentives, access incentives, and a take title provision, which offered states the option of taking title to and possession of low level radioactive waste generated within their borders and assuming liability for damages that waste generators suffer due to the states' tardiness. New York sued, claiming that the Act violated U.S. Const. amend. X.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> While Congress has substantial powers to govern the nation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to the states, the Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the states to govern according to Congress' instructions.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Affirmed in part and reversed in part; monetary and access incentives were permissible exercises of Congressional power under the commerce, tax, and spending clauses, but the take title provision violated U.S. Const. amend. X because it was coercive.</li>

#### Congressional Alternatives to Commandeering
- Spending power (Do all this and we will give you money.)
  - Under spending clause, Congress may condition the payment of relevant federal funds on a state's agreement to take title to waste if it has not already provided a waste disposal facility.
- Commerce Power
  - Under Commerce clause, Congress may pass federal legislation directly regulating the private producers of low level radioactive waste to limit their production.
  - Congress may impose a federal tax on interstate commerce and authorize the states to burden out of state commerce.
- Conditional Preemption (The Federal Government takes over regulation from states)
  - Congress may threaten to pass federal legislation under the Commerce Clause unless states choose to regulate according to federal standards.

  - State and Local Law Enforcement Officials

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Congressional enactment that temporarily required petitioners, state law enforcement officials, to participate in administration of a federal regulatory scheme for gun control unconstitutionally violated state autonomy.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In 1993, Congress amended the Gun Control Act of 1968 by enacting the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act ("Brady Act"). The Brady Act mandated the establishment of a national system for instant criminal background checks of proposed handgun transferees. The Brady Act amended a detailed federal scheme that governed distribution of firearms established by the Gun Control Act of 1968. Interim provisions directed state law enforcement officers to participate in administration of a federally enacted regulatory scheme. Petitioners, chief law enforcement officials (CLEO) of their respective counties, objected to being pressed into federal service and contended that congressional action that compelled state officers to execute federal laws was unconstitutional. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can Congress compel states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress cannot compel the states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the state's officers directly. The federal government may neither issue directives requiring the states to address particular problems, nor command the states' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Supreme Court agreed and held that the interim provisions violated constitutional principles of dual sovereignty and separation of powers. Congress could not compel states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Congress could not circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the state's officers directly. The Brady Act effectively transferred the executive branch's responsibility to administer federal laws to thousands of CLEOs in 50 states, who were left to implement the program without meaningful presidential control.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 was constitutional because Congress properly exercised its authority to regulate interstate commerce under Commerce Clause and did not run afoul of federalism principles.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The state and its attorney general sued the United States, alleging that the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA) violated U.S. Const. amends. X and XI. The district court granted summary judgment for the State and permanently enjoined the DPPA's enforcement against respondents. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the DPPA violate the Tenth Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 2721-2725 (1994 & Supp. III), is a proper exercise of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl.3</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held the DPPA was a proper exercise of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce because drivers' information was an article of commerce and its sale or release into the interstate stream of business was sufficient to support congressional regulation. The court rejected respondents' argument that the DPPA violated the principles of federalism contained in U.S. Const. amend. X since it did not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or regulations, and it did not require state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> The State could not be sued without its consent where a federal statute clearly intended to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity, but the United States Constitution did not grant Congress that power.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner tribe sued the State and its governor, alleging that they refused to enter into any negotiation for the inclusion of gaming activities in a tribal-state compact thereby violating 25 U.S.C.S. § 2710(d)(3). In their unsuccessful motion to dismiss the complaint, the State and the governor asserted that the suit violated the State's sovereign immunity under U.S. Const. amend. XI. The State and the governor took an interlocutory appeal of the decision that denied their motion to dismiss. The appellate court reversed, holding that amend. XI, barred the tribe's suit. On certiorari, the Court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did Congress "unequivocally" express its intent to abrogate the immunity?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> In order to determine whether Congress has abrogated the states' sovereign immunity, we ask two questions: first, whether Congress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity, and second, whether Congress has acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court affirmed because amend. XI, prohibited Congress from making the State capable of being sued in federal court. Notwithstanding Congress' clear intent to abrogate states' sovereign immunity through the gaming act, the Indian Commerce Clause did not grant Congress that power. </li>

Petitioners alleged that respondent violated the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. § 201 et seq., and they sought compensation and liquidated damages. The district court dismissed petitioners' action, and the court of appeals and the state supreme court affirmed. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Do the powers delegated to Congress under U.S. Const. Art. I include the power to subject nonconsenting states to private suits for damages in state courts?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Eleventh Amendment makes explicit reference to the states' immunity from suits commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the district court rendered the correct decision; hence, it affirmed the dismissal of the petitioners’ action. The Court reasoned that the powers delegated to Congress under U.S. Const. Art. I did not include the power to subject nonconsenting states to private suits for damages in state courts and that respondent did not consent to suits for overtime pay and liquidated damages under the FLSA.</li>

## The National Taxing and Spending Powers and Their Federalism-Based Limits
#### The Taxing Power as a Regulatory Device
- Article 1 § 8
  - Congress invoking the taxing power when commerce clause seems unusable

#### Case: *[Child Labor Tax Case - Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.](Link)*
- [Hammer v. Dagenhart](link), the Court held unconstitutional Congress's efforts to regulate child labor through exercise of the commerce power.
  - Congress enabled Child Labor Tax Law - imposing a federal excise tax

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Child Labor Tax was invalidated because it sought to regulate state child labor, an exclusive state function, through imposing a penalty on those such as a manufacturer who failed to act in accordance with Congress' wishes.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff incurred tax liability under the Child Labor Tax Law (Law), 40 Stat. 1057, 1138 (1919), by permitting a child to work in its factory. After paying the tax bill under protest, plaintiff brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Law and sought a tax refund. It is contended that the Law regulates employment of child labor which is an exclusively state function. The District Court struck the Child Labor Tax Law for being an invalid exercise of state function. Defendant appealed from the lower court's entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the Child Labor Tax Law unconstitutional for being an invalid exercise of state power?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Where a sovereign enacting a law has power to impose both tax and penalty the difference between revenue production and mere regulation may be immaterial, but not so when one sovereign can impose a tax only, and the power of regulation rests in another. Taxes are occasionally imposed in the discretion of the legislature on proper subjects with the primary motive of obtaining revenue from them and with the incidental motive of discouraging them by making their continuance onerous. They do not lose their character as taxes because of the incidental motive. There comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of regulation and punishment.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court on appeal affirmed, holding that the Law was an impermissible attempt to regulate employment of child labor, an exclusive state function reserved under U.S. Const. amend. X. The Court held that the Law was not an allowable federal government excise tax but rather a penalty enacted to coerce state citizens to act in accordance with Congress' views on child labor. The Law was not naturally and reasonably adapted to collection of a tax but an impermissible attempt to achieve a purpose solely within state power.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A decision that an excise tax on wagering was unconstitutional was improper because the tax was not arbitrary and was regulatory in nature.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The issue raised by this appeal is the constitutionality of the occupational tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1951, which levy a tax on persons engaged in the business of accepting wagers, and require such persons to register with the Collector of Internal Revenue. The unconstitutionality of the tax is asserted on two grounds. First, it is said that Congress, under the pretense of exercising its power to tax has attempted to penalize illegal intrastate gambling through the regulatory features of the Act (26 U. S. C. (Supp. V) § 3291) and has thus infringed the police power which is reserved to the states. Secondly, it is urged that the registration provisions of the tax violate the privilege against self-incrimination and are arbitrary and vague, contrary to the guarantees of the Fifth Amendment</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is a wagering tax an unconstitutional regulation of matters within the exclusive power of the states and does it violate the guarantee against self-incrimination of the Fifth Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Unless there are provisions extraneous to any tax need, courts are without authority to limit the exercise of the taxing power. The remedy for excessive taxation is in the hands of Congress, not the courts.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court found that the excise tax had a regulatory effect, produced revenue, and clearly defined the activities covered and excluded. The court also found that the registration requirements of the excise tax on wagering were not offensive. The court further found that the required data was directly and intimately related to the collection of the tax and were obviously supportable as in aid of a revenue purpose. The court also rejected the taxpayer's argument that the excise tax was a denial of the privilege against self-incrimination. The court determined that under the registration provisions of the excise tax, the taxpayer was not compelled to confess to acts already committed, he was merely informed by the statute that in order to engage in the business of wagering in the future he must fulfill certain conditions. A majority of the Supreme Court, in reversing the dismissal, held, in an opinion by Reed, J., that the wagering tax, since it produced revenue, was not an unconstitutional regulation of matters within the exclusive power of the states; did not violate the guarantee against self-incrimination of the Fifth Amendment, since it did not compel tax registrants to confess to acts already committed; and did not employ arbitrary classification or vague statutory definitions violative of due process.</li>

#### Case: *[United States v. Butler](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A cotton tax imposed on receivers under the Agricultural Adjustment Act was an unconstitutional assertion of power by Congress and invaded the reserved rights of the states to regulate and control agricultural production.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the government claimed cotton taxes from respondent receivers and the receivers recommended that the claim be disallowed. The government argued that the Act was valid because Congress was authorized to appropriate and authorize spending for the "general welfare" under U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7, and that the Act was an effort to aid farmers during the great depression. The district court found the taxes valid and ordered them paid, but the United States Circuit Court of Appeals reversed on appeal. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the Agricultural Adjustment Act valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 confers upon the Congress power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States. The true construction of this clause undoubtedly is that the only thing granted is the power to tax for the purpose of providing funds for payment of the nation's debts and making provision for the general welfare.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that while the Act might have been within Congress' power if it fell within the ambit of the term "general welfare," the Court did not have to reach the question of the interpretation of that whether it did so because the Act was unconstitutional on other grounds. The Act was clearly designed to regulate agriculture by coercing a non-cooperating minority to a desired action with economic pressure. However, the power to regulate agriculture was not granted to Congress by the Constitution, but rather, was reserved to the States. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement, were possibly permissible means to an unconstitutional end. Thus, Congress had no power to enforce its commands on the farmer to the ends sought by the Act, and it could not indirectly accomplish those ends by taxing and spending to purchase compliance.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> An act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' to navigate steamboats in waters of the United States, and the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the state was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A state act gave an exclusive right to certain individuals to use steam navigation in all the waters of New York for 30 years from 1808. An injunction was issued restraining defendants from navigating steamboats in the waters within the state because of this exclusive privilege, which defendants violated. Defendants contended that the privilege violated an act of Congress which regulated the licensing of ships and vessels in the coasting trade and fisheries and was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The state court found in favor of the plaintiff, and defendants appealed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the waters of the state valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>
    In regulating commerce with foreign nations, the power of Congress does not stop at the jurisdictional lines of the several states. The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, is that of the whole United States. Because Congress has the power to regulate commerce, that power must be exercised whenever the subject exists. If a foreign voyage may commence or terminate at a port within a state, then the power of Congress may be exercised within a state.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed, finding that the act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' vessels to navigate the waters of the United States. The law of the state of New York, prohibiting the vessels from navigating the waters of the state, was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> A state law was upheld as constitutional because the constitutional grant to Congress of the power to regulate commerce did not deprive the states of the power to regulate pilots.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Pilots brought writs of error and sought to be exempted from the payment of half-pilotage fees, which they were required to pay pursuant to a state law that required certain ships to either receive a pilot or pay a fee. They contended that the state law contravened provisions of the Constitution. They also complained that the state law was repugnant to the provision of the Constitution that provided that Congress had the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found the state law constitutional and valid. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is a state regulation involving the regulation of pilots constitutional and valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The grant of a power to Congress, does not imply a prohibition on the states to exercise the same power. It is not the mere existence of such a power, but its exercise by Congress, which may be incompatible with the exercise of the same power by the states, and the states may legislate in the absence of congressional regulations. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court affirmed the finding that the state law was valid and not in conflict with any provisions of the Constitution. The Court found that the grant to Congress of the power to regulate commerce did not deprive the states of the power to regulate pilots. Although Congress was granted such power, nothing required that it should be exercised exclusively by Congress.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Statute permitting four categories of waste to enter state and excluding parties it had previous waste agreements with was unconstitutional because it was not a law directed at legitimate local concerns with incidental effects on interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, landfill operators, brought an action against defendants, state and department, arguing that N.J. Stat. Ann. 13:1I-10 was unconstitutional because it permitted four categories of waste to enter the state, and excluded plaintiffs. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and the lower appellate court reversed, finding that the statute advanced vital health and environmental objectives with no economic discrimination against interstate commerce. The Supreme Court reversed the lower appellate court's decision.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the statutory prohibition violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The statute was a protectionist measure and not a law directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental. The court concluded that no matter what defendant's ultimate purpose was, it could not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the state unless there was some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently. The court concluded that the contested statute both on its face and in its plain effect violated the principle of nondiscrimination because on its face, it imposed on out-of-state commercial interests the full burden of conserving the state's remaining landfill space.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> A city ordinance prohibiting the sale of milk in the city unless it was pasteurized within five miles of the city was unconstitutional because it imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce and reasonable and adequate alternatives were available.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellant corporation, a milk distributor, was denied a license to sell its products within the city based upon the fact that the corporation's pasteurization plants were more than five miles away from the city, as mandated by a Wisconsin ordinance. Appellant brought a suit against the appellee city, represented by Health Commissioner of Madison, challenging the statute's constitutionality.  The Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed the constitutionality of the ordinances. On review, the Court reversed the decision of the lower court, vacated the lower court's judgment on the issue of the five-mile provision, and remanded the case for further proceedings with respect to the ordinance containing the 25-mile inspection provision.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the ordinance unjustifiably discriminate against interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A city cannot discriminate against interstate commerce, even in the exercise of its unquestioned power to protect the health and safety of its people, if reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, adequate to conserve legitimate local interests, are available.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court determined that, under the Commerce Clause, § 7.21 imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce because, in effect, the ordinance excluded from distribution in the city wholesale milk produced and pasteurized in an adjoining state. The Court found that the city had erected an economic barrier protecting a major local industry against competition from outside the state, plainly discriminating against interstate commerce. Furthermore, reasonable and adequate health standard alternatives were available. Accordingly, the Court held that § 7.21 violated the Commerce Clause. Because the state supreme court had found it unnecessary to pass on the validity of the separate 25-mile inspection limitation in Madison, Wis., Gen. Ordinances § 7.11 (1949), the Court remanded for further proceedings.</li>

Petitioner was cited for violating the town's ordinance, and petitioner filed suit in federal court challenging it. The town filed a state court action, and the ordinance was ruled constitutional. The state appellate courts affirmed that ruling. The court reversed because the ordinance violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Alaska's requirement that timber taken from state lands be processed within the state prior to export was not implicitly authorized by Congress' adoption of a similar policy with respect to federal lands in Alaska.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner was an Alaska corporation engaged in the business of purchasing and logging timber and shipping the logs into foreign commerce. It did not operate a mill in Alaska and usually sold unprocessed logs. Respondent state of Alaska had a requirement that timber taken from state lands be processed within the state prior to export. Petitioner sought an injunction, arguing that the requirement violated the negative implications of the Commerce Clause. The trial court agreed, but the appellate court reversed, finding it unnecessary to reach the question whether, standing alone, the requirement would violate the Commerce Clause because it found implicit congressional authorization for the state requirement in the existence of a federal policy imposing a similar requirement on timber taken from federal lands in Alaska. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the decision of the appellate court proper?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Although the Commerce Clause is by its text an affirmative grant of power to Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, the Clause is also recognized as a self-executing limitation on the power of the states to enact laws imposing substantial burdens on such commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed and remanded, holding that Alaska's requirement for in-state processing of timber prior to its export was not authorized by Congress. Mrreover, the Court held that there was insufficient evidence of congressional intent. Because Congress had acted only with respect to federal lands, the court concluded that it could not infer that Congress intended to authorize a similar policy with respect to state lands. The court failed to reach a majority decision on the question of whether, in the absence of congressional authorization, the requirement could still be found not to violate "dormant" Commerce Clause requirements.</li>

### Facially Neutral Laws with Protectionist Purpose or Effect

#### Case: *[Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> State officials were precluded from extending the system of minimum prices set up by the New York Milk Control Act to milk that had been obtained by a milk dealer in another state.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The New York Milk Control Act (Act), 1933 N.Y. Laws 158, 1934 N.Y. Laws 126, established a system of minimum prices to be paid by milk dealers to producers in New York. The milk dealer bought its milk in Vermont at prices lower than the New York minimum and refused to agree to conform to the New York statute and regulations in the sale of the imported product. The milk dealer was thus unable to obtain a New York business license. Eventually, the milk dealer sought to restrain state officials from prosecuting it for selling milk imported from Vermont without a license in New York. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is it valid for a New York state law to prohibit sale of milk imported from Vermont if it does not conform to a pricing criteria?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A state tax upon merchandise brought in from another state, or upon its sales, whether in original packages or not, after it has reached its destination and is in a state of rest, is lawful only when the tax is not discriminating in its incidence against the merchandise because of its origin in another state. In brief, the test of the original package is not an ultimate principle. It is an illustration of a principle. It marks a convenient boundary and one sufficiently precise save in exceptional conditions. What is ultimate is the principle that one state in its dealings with another may not place itself in a position of economic isolation. Formulas and catchwords are subordinate to this overmastering requirement. Neither the power to tax nor the police power may be used by the state of destination with the aim and effect of establishing an economic barrier against competition with the products of another state or the labor of its residents. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the district court properly restrained the enforcement of the Act in its application to sales in the original packages but erred in refusing to grant an injunction with respect to milk in bottles. The form of the packages was immaterial. New York's attempt to regulate the price to be paid for milk acquired in Vermont had the same unconstitutional effect as a customs duty. The Court rejected the state officials' arguments that the purpose of the Act was not to protect its farmers from competition but to ensure an adequate supply of milk and to avoid tempting farmers to save the expense of sanitary precautions. Allowing a health exception would have destroyed the rule, and the relation was too indirect to obstruct interstate commerce.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A New York statute which required a milk processor to receive a license for a receiving plant was unconstitutional as applied. The statute violated the Commerce Clause because its purpose was to restrain competition.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner milk processor sought certiorari review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision of respondent New York Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets denying an extension of the milk processor's license. The milk processor contended that N.Y. Agric. & Mkts. Law Section 258-c, which authorized the license requirement, violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The milk processor was a Massachusetts corporation that received milk in New York and shipped it to Massachusetts for processing. The New York Commissioner denied the milk processor's application for an additional receiving facility in New York.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether a commissioner's rejection of an out of state corporation's application for an in-state milk processing facility was a violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Our system, fostered by the Commerce Clause, is that every farmer and every craftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will have free access to every market in the nation, that no home embargoes will withhold his exports, and no foreign state will by customs duties or regulations exclude them. Likewise, every consumer may look to the free competition from every producing area in the nation to protect him from exploitation by any. Such was the vision of the Founders; such has been the doctrine of the Supreme Court which has given it reality.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that the licensing statute violated the Commerce Clause. The court held that the statute was an attempt ot protect New York's commercial interests by restricting the export of milk to milk processors in other states that competed with New York milk processors. The statute's primary purpose was not regulation with a view to safety but the prohibition of competition. The court held that the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act did not authorize the unconstitutional licensing scheme. Although the act authorized federal officials to confer with and enter into agreements with state authorities regarding the marketing of milk and several such agreements were in effect, no such agreement or order authorized the licensing scheme.The judgment upholding the decision of the New York Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets was reversed, and the case remanded.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> Iowa state, claiming that double trailers were less safe than single tractor-trailers, enacted a law that banned the use of 65-foot long double trailers from its interstate highways; exemptions were granted to border cities, farm vehicles, and trucks manufactured and mobile homes moved within the state Because of the statutory ban, the trucking firm was required either to divert its trucks from Iowa or detach trailers to shuttle them separately through the state. The lower courts declared the statute unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. On appeal, the court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the state law constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A state's power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local concern. For example, regulations that touch upon safety, especially highway safety, are those that the United States Supreme Court is most reluctant to invalidate. Indeed, if safety justifications are not illusory, the court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison with related burdens on interstate commerce. Those who would challenge such bona fide safety regulations must overcome a "strong presumption of validity."</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The state failed to present any persuasive evidence that double trailers were in fact less safe than single ones and found that the statute deferred to local interests while substantially burdening the flow of interstate goods. It noted that although normally state highway safety regulations were given deference by the courts and were presumptively valid, that presumption was overcome where the negative impact on interstate commerce was substantial and the alleged safety reasons for enacting the statute were unproven.</li>

### Congressional Ordering of Federal-State Relationships by Preemption and Consent

#### Case: *[Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm'n](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A state statute that placed a moratorium on nuclear plants due to economical concerns of long-term storage of spent fuel rods was not preempted by the Atomic Energy Act's pervasive regulation of the radiological safety aspects of nuclear plants.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A California statute provides that, before additional nuclear power plants may be built, the state energy commission must determine on a case-by-case basis that there will be adequate capacity for storage of a plant's spent fuel rods at the time such nuclear facility requires such storage. Another section of the statute imposes a moratorium on the certification of new nuclear plants until the energy commission finds that there has been developed and that the United States through its authorized agency has approved and there exists a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. Two electric utility companies brought an action, requesting that the two sections of the California statute be declared invalid under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution(Art VI, cl 2) because they are pre-empted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 USCS 2011 et seq.). The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California held that the utility companies had standing to challenge the two sections, that the issues were ripe for adjudication, and that the two provisions were void because they were pre-empted by and in conflict with the Atomic Energy Act (489 F Supp 699). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that the utility companies had standing and also agreed on the ripeness for review of the challenge to the provision imposing a moratorium on certification until the energy commission finds that there exists a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that the challenge to the provision requiring the energy commission to determine on a case-by-case basis that there will be adequate capacity for storage of a plant's spent fuel rods was not ripe for review. The Court of Appeals held on the merits that the nuclear moratorium provisions that were ripe for adjudication were not pre-empted (659 F2d 903).</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can a federal law preempt a state law even if they are not mutually exclusive?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Within constitutional limits Congress may pre-empt state authority by so stating in express terms. Absent explicit language, Congress' intent to supersede state law altogether may be found from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the states to supplement it, because the Act of Congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject, or because the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose. Where Congress has not entirely displaced state regulation in a specific area, state law is pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law, which arises when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility, or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 25524.2 was not preempted by the ACE because § 25524.2 was concerned with the costs of long-term storage, while the ACE pervasively regulated the radiological safety aspects of the construction and operation of nuclear plants. Therefore, § 25524.2 did not interfere with the objectives of the ACE. In sum, Congress has not required States to "go nuclear," in whole or in part. The Atomic Energy Act's twin goals were to promote the development of a technology and to ensure the safety of that technology. Although that Act reserves to the NRC decisions about how to build and operate nuclear plants, the Court reads too much into the Act in suggesting that it also limits the States' traditional power to decide what types of electric power to utilize. Congress simply has made the nuclear option available, and a State may decline that option for any reason. Rather than rest on the elusive test of legislative motive, therefore, it was concluded that the decision whether to build nuclear plants remains with the States. A ban on construction of nuclear powerplants would be valid even if its authors were motivated by fear of a core meltdown or other nuclear catastrophe.</li>

## The Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV

#### Case: *[United Building & Construction Trades Council v. Mayor and Council of Camden](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Privileges and Immunities Clause imposed a direct restraint on state action in the interests of interstate harmony. It was discrimination against out-of-state residents in employment, a matter of fundamental concern, which triggered the clause.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A municipal ordinance required that at least 40 percent of the employees of contractors and subcontractors working on city construction projects be city residents. The council challenged the ordinance as ultra vires and as unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause. The state supreme court declined to apply the Privileges and Immunities Clause in the context of a municipal ordinance that had identical effects upon out-of-state citizens and state citizens not residing in the municipal locality. The council appealed, raising the same three challenges. The council abandoned the Commerce Clause challenge, and the 40 percent quota was changed to a hiring goal.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the ordinance violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Commerce Clause acts as an implied restraint upon state regulatory powers. Such powers must give way before the superior authority of congress to legislate on, or leave unregulated matters involving interstate commerce. When the state acts solely as a market participant, no conflict between state regulation and federal regulatory authority can arise. The Privileges and Immunities Clause, on the other hand, imposes a direct restraint on state action in the interests of interstate harmony. This concern with comity cuts across the market regulator-market participant distinction that is crucial under the Commerce Clause. It is discrimination against out-of-state residents on matters of fundamental concern, which triggers the Clause, not regulation affecting interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court concluded that the challenged ordinance was properly subject to the strictures of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The ordinance was not immune from constitutional review at the behest of out-of-state residents merely because some in-state residents were similarly disadvantaged. The Court, therefore, reversed the judgment of the state supreme court and remanded the case for a determination of the validity of the ordinance under the appropriate constitutional standard.</li>

#### Case: *[Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Residency requirements, which denied appellee the opportunity to be admitted to the New Hampshire bar, and which were alleged to protect the state's interests, violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee applied and passed the New Hampshire bar. Appellant New Hampshire Supreme Court informed her that she would have to establish a home address in New Hampshire prior to being sworn in pursuant to H. Sup. Ct. R. 42, that excluded nonresidents from the bar. Appellee filed an action, alleging that the rule violated the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution, Article IV 2. The district court ruled in appellee’s favor. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. On further appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the appellate court’s decision.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did appellant New Hampshire Supreme Court’s bar residency requirement violate the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution, Article IV 2?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, §2, does not preclude discrimination against nonresidents where (i) there is a substantial reason for the difference in treatment; and (ii) the discrimination practiced against nonresidents bears a substantial relationship to the state's objective.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Bar residency requirements violated the Constitution because appellee's interest in practicing law was protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the state's reasons for discriminating were not substantial. In the instant case, it was considered whether the discrimination bore a close or substantial relationship to the state's objectives and considered the availability of less restrictive means. The means chosen did not bear the necessary relationship to the state's objectives. Appellee would have been accepted to the bar of New Hampshire had appellee established a home address in New Hampshire</li>

# Separation of Powers

#### Case: *[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The President's military and executive powers did not give the President constitutional authority to issue an order directing the seizure of the nation's steel mills; the seizure could not stand because the President did not have lawmaking power.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A labor dispute between the steel industry and its employees was referred by the President to the Federal Wage Stabilization Board. The Board's recommendation resulted in no settlement. When the union gave notice of a nation-wide strike, an executive order was issued directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the nation's steel mills. The steel companies obeyed the orders but brought proceedings against the government, charging that the seizure was not authorized by an act of Congress or by any constitutional provision. The district court granted a preliminary injunction restraining the government's continued seizure and possession of the mills, and the court of appeals stayed the injunction.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the presidential order directing the government to take possession of the plants within the President's constitutional authority?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The President's power, if any, to issue an order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the United States Constitution itself. There is no statute that expressly authorizes the President to take possession of property to settle a labor dispute. Nor is there any act of Congress from which such a power can fairly be implied.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the presidential power exerted here could not be sustained as an exercise of the President's military power nor under the several constitutional provisions that granted executive power. The seizure could not stand because Congress had the exclusive constitutional authority to make laws necessary and proper to carry out the powers vested by the Constitution. Accordingly, the district court's judgment was affirmed.</li>

#### Foreign Policy
#### Case: *[Zivotofsky v. Kerry](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The power to recognize or decline to recognize a foreign state and its territorial bounds resided in the President alone. Congress's law was unconstitutional as it was a mandate that the President contradict his prior recognition determination in an official document issued by the Secretary of State.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In 2002, Manachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem to parents who were United States citizens. Manachem's parents requested that the U.S. State Department record his place of birth on his passport as "Israel," in accordance with Section 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2003 (Act). The State Department refused, and instead, issued Manachem a passport that listed "Jerusalem" as his place of birth. His parents sued the Secretary of State on his behalf and sought the enforcement of Section 214(d). The district court dismissed the case on the ground that it presented a non-justiciable political question. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Zivotofsky v. Clinton, reversed that holding and remanded the case. On remand, the district court held that Section 214(d) "impermissibly intereferes" with the President's exclusive power to recognize foreign states. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed and held that the section goes beyond the scope of Congress's passport power to affect United States foreign policy, which is a realm that the Constitution reserves for the executive branch.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does a federal statute that directs the Secretary of State to record the birthplace of an American citizen born in Jerusalem as "Israel," if requested to do so, impermissibly infringe on the President's power to recognize foreign states?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The text and structure of the United States Constitution grant the President the power to recognize foreign nations and governments. The question is whether that power is exclusive. The various ways in which the President may unilaterally effect recognition, and the lack of any similar power vested in Congress, suggest that it is. So, too, do functional considerations. Put simply, the Nation must have a single policy regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the United States and which are not. Foreign countries need to know, before entering into diplomatic relations or commerce with the United States, whether their ambassadors will be received; whether their officials will be immune from suit in federal court; and whether they may initiate lawsuits here to vindicate their rights. These assurances cannot be equivocal.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that, although the Constitution does not explicitly address the issue of recognition of foreign nations, the Reception Clause in Article II of the Constitution, which states that the President will receive foreign ambassadors, grants the President the power to recognize foreign states. The fact that Article II also vests the President with the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors gives the President further control over recognition decisions. Although Congress has a role to play in other aspects of foreign policy, often by granting the President’s formal recognition practical effect, Congress has no such power to initiate international diplomacy without involving the President. Because the question of whether the American government recognizes a foreign nation must have only one answer, the President’s power is assumed to be exclusive, and therefore, Congress cannot act in a manner that contradicts Executive branch policy regarding recognition. The Court also held that precedent and history support the view that the formal recognition power belongs exclusively to the President. Because the Executive branch has maintained a neutral position by not recognizing any nation’s sovereignty over Jerusalem, the federal statute in question unconstitutionally infringes on the President’s recognition power.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> State and federal public policy against acts of confiscation could not prevail against international compact between U.S. and Soviet Union in which Soviet Union assigned to U.S. its claims against U.S. nationals for expropriated property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The United States recognized the Soviet Union in exchange for the Soviet Union assigning to  the  United  States  its  interests  in  a  Russian  insurance  company  in New York. The Soviet Union had nationalized the interest in this insurance company in 1918 and 1919. The United States would use theseassets to pay claims that it and others had against the Soviet Union</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Governmental power over internal affairs is distributed between the national government and the several states. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. Plainly, the external powers of the United States are to be exercised without regard to state laws or policies. Within the field of its powers, whatever the United States rightfully undertakes, it necessarily has warrant to consummate. And when judicial authority is invoked in aid of such consummation, state constitutions, state laws, and state policies are irrelevant to the inquiry and decision. It is inconceivable that any of them can be interposed as an obstacle to the effective operation of a federal constitutional power.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> the Court  stated that “in  the  case  of all international compacts and agreements ... complete power over   international affairs is in the national government and is not and cannot be subject to any curtailment or interference on the part of the several states.</li>

#### Case: *[Dames & Moore v. Regan](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Executive orders having the effect of nullifying a company's claims against Iran were authorized by the Trade With the Enemy Act. The President was authorized to suspend pending claims against Iran because Congress consented.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner company filed an action against defendants, the Government of Iran and Iranian banks, seeking money owed for services performed. The district court issued orders of attachment directed against the property of defendants. Petitioner was granted summary judgment. However, pursuant to an unrelated hostage agreement, American hostages in Iran were released. The U.S. President issued executive orders to implement the agreement. The orders nullified all non-Iranian interests in Iranian assets and suspended all settlement claims. Petitioner filed an action for declaratory relief against the government, alleging that the actions of the President was beyond his statutory power. The district court dismissed the complaint. Petitioner then sought a writ of certiorari.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the President has the authority to nullify all attachments obtained on Iranian assets.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congressional purpose in authorizing blocking orders is to put control of foreign assets in the hands of the President.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The order of the President nullifying all attachments obtained on Iranian assets after the blocking order of November 14, 1979, was authorized by 1702(a)(1)(B) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 USCS 1702(a)(1)(B)), which empowers the President to "compel," "nullify," or "prohibit" any "transfer" with respect to, or transactions involving, any property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in which any foreign country has any interest, the President's action being supported by the strongest presumption and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, since it was taken pursuant to specific congressional authorization, and the corporation had not sustained the heavy burden of persuasion placed upon those attacking the President's action, since the attachment obtained after the blocking order was subject to revocation and specifically made subordinate to further actions which the President might take under the Act, and (2) the order of the President suspending all claims against the government of Iran which may be presented to the Claims Tribunal and providing that such claims shall have no legal effect in any action pending in any court of the United States was within the authority of the President, since Congress had enacted legislation, such as the Economic Powers Act and the Hostage Act (22 USCS 1732), in the area of the President's authority to deal with international crises, and since Congress had implicitly approved the longstanding practice of claims settlements by executive agreement, the President, by suspending the claims, not having circumscribed the jurisdiction of the United States courts in violation of Article III of the Constitution.</li>

#### Case: *[Medellin v. Texas](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> International Court of Justice decision that a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261, entitled a state inmate to reconsideration of his conviction was not directly enforceable, nor could the President unilaterally give the decision domestic effect.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Medellin had been convicted and sentenced in Texas state court for murder, was one of the 51 Mexican nationals named in a decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as being entitled to reconsideration of their convictions based on violations of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations art. 36(1)(b), Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261. The President issued a memorandum determining that state courts were to give effect to the ICJ decision. Relying on the ICJ's decision and the President's Memorandum, Medellin filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medellin's application as an abuse of the writ under state law, given Medellin's failure to raise his Vienna Convention claim in a timely manner under state law. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the decision of the International Court of Justice and the subsequent memorandum of the President constitute directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Not all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in United States courts. A distinction is recognized between treaties that automatically have effect as domestic law, and those that--while they constitute international law commitments--do not by themselves function as binding federal law. A treaty is equivalent to an act of the legislature, and hence self-executing, when it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision. When, in contrast, treaty stipulations are not self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them into effect. In sum, while treaties may comprise international commitments, they are not domestic law unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be "self-executing" and is ratified on those terms. What is meant by "self-executing" is that the treaty has automatic domestic effect as federal law upon ratification. Conversely, a "non-self-executing" treaty does not by itself give rise to domestically enforceable federal law. Whether such a treaty has domestic effect depends upon implementing legislation passed by Congress. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Supreme Court held that neither the ICJ decision nor the President's memorandum constituted directly enforceable federal law that would preempt state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions. The pertinent international agreements, including the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 325, T.I.A.S. No. 6820 and the United Nations Charter, did not provide for direct enforcement of ICJ judgments. Nor could the President unilaterally execute a non-self-executing treaty by giving it domestic effect, as the power to implement such a treaty fell to Congress.</li>

#### Case: *[Trump v. Hawaii](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A presidential proclamation placing entry restrictions on nationals from eight foreign states was a valid exercise of presidential authority under 8 U.S.C.S. § 1182(f) where the President found that their entry was detrimental to the United States' interests.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States undergo a vetting process to ensure that they satisfy the numerous requirements for admission. The Act also vests the President with authority to restrict the entry of aliens whenever he finds that their entry “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” Relying on that delegation, the President concluded that it was necessary to impose entry restrictions on nationals of countries that do not share adequate information for an informed entry determination, or that otherwise present national security risks. Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017) (Proclamation). Respondents, the State of Hawaii, individuals with relatives affected by the entry suspension, and the Muslim Association of Hawaii, challenged the application of those entry restrictions to certain aliens abroad.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the President have authority under the Act to issue the Proclamation, and did the entry policy violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The rational basis standard of review considers whether the entry policy of Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 is plausibly related to the government’s stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes. As a result, the court may consider extrinsic evidence, but will uphold the policy so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The presidential proclamation placing entry restrictions on nationals from eight foreign states was a valid exercise of presidential authority under 8 U.S.C.S. § 1182(f)where the President found that their entry was detrimental to the United States' interests; [2]-Even if judicial review of those findings was appropriate, the proclamation described the process, agency evaluations, and recommendation underlying the chosen restrictions and made clear that its conditional restrictions remained in force only so long as necessary to address the identified inadequacies and risks within those nations. Although three individuals had standing to challenge the exclusion of relatives under the Establishment Clause, on rational basis review the proclamation was facially legitimate in that it, inter alia, aimed to prevent the entry of nationals who could not be adequately vetted.</li>

#### Case: *[Ex Parte Quirin](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> President had the authority under the Constitution to try petitioners for war crimes before a military tribunal, instead of a civil proceeding, since petitioners were accused of being unlawful belligerents under the Articles of War.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Eight German-born U.S. residents were captured by the United States as they tried to enter the country during war time, for the purpose of sabotage, espionage, hostile or warlike acts, or violations under the law of war. The President of the United States held that petitioners were to be tried before a military tribunal under the Articles of War. The 8 captured residents challenged the President's authority, arguing that under the U.S. Constitution they had a right to demand a jury trial in the civil courts. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did belligerents caught entering the United States during wartime have the right to demand a jury trial in the civil courts?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> By universal agreement and practice, the law of war draws a distinction between the armed forces and the peaceful populations of belligerent nations and also between those who are lawful and unlawful combatants. Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces. Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful. The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an enemy combatant who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court found that petitioners were alleged to be unlawful belligerents, and that under the Articles of War, they were not entitled to be tried in a civil proceeding, nor by a jury. The court also determined that trying petitioners before a military court was not illegal and did not violate the U.S. Const. amends. V and VI relating to "crimes" and "criminal prosecutions." Thus, the court affirmed the President's authority to try petitioners before a military tribunal without a jury.</li>

#### Case: *[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Although the Government was authorized to detain a citizen-detainee who was allegedly an enemy combatant, he was entitled to a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Yaser Hamdi is an American citizen who was apprehended  in Afghanistan and brought to Guantánamo Bay. There it was discovered that he is an American citizen and he was taken to a military prison in South Carolina. He has been held as an enemy combatant and never has  been  charged with any crime. His situation is identical to that of John Walker Lindh, excep that Lindh was indicted and pled guilty  to crimes.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>  Does  the federal  government  have  the  authority  to  hold  an  American  citizen apprehended  in  a  foreign  country  as  an  enemy  combatant?  Was the petition for habeas corpus properly dismissed? What,  if  any,  process  mustbe  accorded  to  Hamdi?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Regarding the tension that often exists between the autonomy that the Government asserts is necessary in order to pursue effectively a particular goal and the process that a citizen contends he is due before he is deprived of a constitutional right, the ordinary mechanism that the United States Supreme Court uses for balancing such serious competing interests, and for determining the procedures that are necessary to ensure that a citizen is not deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, Mathews dictates that the process due in any given instance is determined by weighing the private interest that will be affected by the official action against the Government's asserted interest, including the function involved and the burdens the Government would face in providing greater process. The Mathews calculus then contemplates a judicious balancing of these concerns, through an analysis of the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the private interest if the process were reduced and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute safeguards.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Hamdi's detention was authorized pursuant  to  an  Act  of  Congress:  the  Authorization  for  Use  of  Military Force that was passed after September 11. Justice O'Connor stated thatthis  constituted  sufficient  congressional  authorization  to  meet  the requirements  of  the  Non-Detention  Act  and  to  permit  detaining  anAmerican  citizen  apprehended  in  a  foreign  country  as  an  enemy combatant. Hamdi  is  entitled  to  have  his  habeas  corpus  petition heard  in  federal  court  and  that  imprisoning  a  person  is  obviously  the most basic form of deprivation of liberty. Thus, due process is requiredand  the  procedures  required  are  to  be  determined  by  applying  the three-part  balancing  test  under Mathews  v.  Eldridge, which  instructscourts  to  weigh  the  importance  of  the  interest  to  the  individual,  theability  of  additional  procedures  to  reduce  the  risk  of  an  erroneous deprivation, and the government's interests.</li>

#### Case: *[Boumediene v. Bush](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Alien detainees were entitled to seek a writ of habeas corpus to challenge their detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 28 U.S.C.S. § 2241(e) violated U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2, as the procedures of the Detainee Treatment Act, 109 Pub. L. No. 148, 119 Stat. 2680, were not an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> In light of the statutes passed by Congress, do the petitioners, aliens detained at Guantanamo, have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> We hold that Art. I, §9, cl. 2, of the Constitutionhas  full  effect  at  Guantánamo  Bay.  If  the  privilege  of  habeas  corpus  isto  be  denied  to  the  detainees  now  before  us,  Congress  must  act  inaccordance   with   the   requirements   of   the ​Suspension   Clause. The Court held that petitioners have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus. They are not barred from seeking the writ or invoking the Suspension Clause's protections because they have been designated as enemy combatants or because of their presence at Guantanamo. According to the Court,  a brief account of the writ's history and origins shows that protection for the habeas privilege was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution that, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights; in the system the Framers conceived, the writ has a centrality that must inform proper interpretation of the Suspension Clause. That the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument for the protection of individual liberty is evident from the care taken in the Suspension Clause to specify the limited grounds for its suspension: The writ may be suspended only when public safety requires it in times of rebellion or invasion. The Clause is designed to protect against cyclical abuses of the writ by the Executive and Legislative Branches. It protects detainee rights by a means consistent with the Constitution's essential design, ensuring that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the "delicate balance of governance.”</li>

### Congressional Authority to Restrain and Enable the Executive

#### Nondelegation Doctrine
#### Case: *[United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendants' demurrer to charges that they violated a joint resolution of Congress which barred arms sales to nations designated by the President was improperly granted despite the President's repeal of his proclamation barring arms sales to Bolivia.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A joint resolution of Congress authorized the President to declare the sale of arms to certain countries illegal. Though the President initially issued a proclamation that declared that sales to Bolivia were unlawful, the President later revoked his proclamation. Defendants allegedly sold arms to Bolivia before the revocation of the proclamation, and demurred to the charges against them on the ground that the revocation of the proclamation precluded their prosecution. Trial court granted the demurrer.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> May Congress delegate to the president authority to promulgate laws in matters of foreign affairs?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations is a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the United States Constitution. If, in the maintenance of international relations, embarrassment - perhaps serious embarrassment - is to be avoided and success for national aims achieved, congressional legislation which is to be made effective through negotiation and inquiry within the international field must often accord to the President a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved. Moreover, he, not Congress, has the better opportunity of knowing the conditions which prevail in foreign countries, and especially is this true in time of war. He has his confidential sources of information. He has his agents in the form of diplomatic, consular and other officials. Secrecy in respect of information gathered by them may be highly necessary, and the premature disclosure of it productive of harmful results.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The President is the representative of the country in discussing matters of foreign affairs. It is found that the President is better to address and identify issues of the country on a national level, most especially because the President has access to confidential information that has to do with consular, diplomatic and foreign affairs. Moreover, the President had broad discretion to determine the benefit of enforcing a joint resolution on international relations. The power to make decisions regarding international affairs was vested in the President, especially in areas that could lead to embarrassment of or security issues for the nation. Defendants' argument that the power to declare certain arms sales illegal was invalidly delegated to the President was unjustified. The revocation of the proclamation did not change defendants' violation of the joint resolution; the revocation only stopped the joint resolution from being enforced against sales to Bolivia in the future. The judgment granting defendants' demurrer was reversed and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The cancellation provisions of the Line Item Veto Act violates U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2. </li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Line Item Veto Act, which gave the President of the United States authority to cancel certain spending and tax benefit measures after the President had signed such measures into law, contained an expedited-review provision which authorized any individual" adversely affected by the Line Item Veto Act to bring a declaratory judgment action alleging that any provision of the Line Item Veto Act. After the President exercised his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel certain measures, several actions that sought declaratory judgment that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional and thus that a particular cancellation was invalid were brought against the President and other federal officials .The United States District Court for the District of Columbia determined that the Line Item Veto Act violated the Constitution's presentment clause, Art I, 7, cl 2, and the doctrine of separation of powers.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Line Item Veto Act (Act),  U.S.C.S. § 692, which authorizes expedited review, evidences an unmistakable congressional interest in a prompt and authoritative judicial determination of the constitutionality of the Act. Subsection 692(a)(2) requires that copies of any complaint filed under subsection 692(a)(1) "shall be promptly delivered" to both Houses of Congress, and that each House shall have a right to intervene. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The United States Supreme Court affirmed that the cancellation procedures set forth in the Act violated the Presentment Clause of the Constitution,U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2 . The Court held that constitutional silence on the subject of unilateral Presidential action that either repeals or amends parts of duly enacted statutes is equivalent to an express prohibition. Thus, cancellations pursuant to the Act had no legal force or effect and failed to satisfy the procedures set out in Article I, § 7.</li>

#### Fettering Executive Removal Power
#### Case: *[Myers v. United States](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> President was empowered to remove postmaster from his appointment, notwithstanding the specific provision for his removal only with advice of the Senate, on the ground that the power of removal inhered in the power to appoint.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellant, the administratrix of postmaster's estate, sought review of a judgment that rejected a claim for the postmaster's salary where he was removed from office before the expiration of his term by an order of the President, without the Senate's approval, in contravention of § 6 of the Act of Congress, 19 Stat. 80 (1876). The lower court's judgment was premised on a finding that the postmaster had lost his right of action because of his delay in suing. The Supreme Court held he had not lost his right to sue where he acted conscientiously in asserting his rights. In the absence of a constitutional or statutory provision otherwise, the President could by virtue of his general power of appointment remove an officer on the ground that the power of removal inhered in the power to appoint, even though he was appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and notwithstanding specific provisions for his removal for cause. Thus, the Court held that § 6 of the Act under which the unrestricted power to remove first class postmasters was denied to the President, violated the Constitution was invalid.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Under the Constitution, does the President have the exclusive power of removing executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> In the absence of a Constitutional or statutory provision otherwise, the President can by virtue of his general power of appointment remove an officer, though appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and not-withstanding specific provisions for his removal for cause, on the ground that the power of removal inhered in the power to appoint. This is an indication that many statutes are to be reconciled to the unrestricted power of the President to remove, if he chooses to exercise his power. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The judgment denying request for postmaster's salary by appellant, admistratrix of postmaster's estate, was affirmed because the President was empowered to remove postmaster from his appointment, even though postmaster was appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and notwithstanding the specific provision for his removal for cause, on the ground that the power of removal inhered in the power to appoint.</li>

#### The Constitutionality of Independent Counsel

#### Case: *[Morrison v. Olsen](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was not invalid. It did not violate the Appointments Clause, Article III of the United States Constitution, or the separation-of-powers principle by impermissibly interfering with the executive branch.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Special Division appointed appellant as independent counsel to investigate appellees (Olson) for violations of federal criminal laws pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 28 U.S.C.S § 591 et seq. Appellant caused a grand jury to issue and serve subpoenas on appellees. All three appellees moved to quash the subpoenas, claiming that the independent counsel provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. The court upheld the Act's constitutionality, denied the motions, and later ordered that appellees be held in contempt for continuing to refuse to comply with the subpoenas. The trial court dismissed appellees' motions, but the appellate court reversed the decision when it found that the Act violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.  </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the power granted to the Special Division an encroachment on Executive power?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The various powers delegated by the Ethics in Government Act to the Division are not supervisory or administrative, nor are they functions that the Constitution requires be performed by officials within the Executive Branch. The Act does give a federal court power to review the Attorney General's decision to remove an independent counsel, but this is a function that is well within the traditional power of the Judiciary.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Article III of the Constitution does not absolutely prevent Congress from vesting certain miscellaneous powers in the Special Division under the Act. One purpose of the broad prohibition upon the courts' exercise of executive or administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature is to maintain the separation between the Judiciary and the other branches of the Federal Government by ensuring that judges do not encroach upon executive or legislative authority or undertake tasks that are more properly accomplished by those branches. Here, the Division's miscellaneous powers -- such as the passive powers to "receive" (but not to act on or specifically approve) various reports from independent counsel or the Attorney General -- do not encroach upon the Executive Branch's authority. The Act simply does not give the Division power to "supervise" the independent counsel in the exercise of counsel's investigative or prosecutorial authority. And, the functions that the Division is empowered to perform are not inherently "Executive," but are directly analogous to functions that federal judges perform in other contexts.</li>

#### Other interbranch Appointments
#### Case: *[Mistretta v. United States](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Sentencing Reform Act was found to be constitutional because Congress had not delegated excessive legislative power or upset the constitutionally mandated balance of powers among the branches of government.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner and respondent both requested certiorari before judgment was rendered to consider the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission. The trial court rejected petitioner's contention that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, petitioner's first contention was that Congress had granted the Commission excessive legislative discretion. The Supreme Court did not agree. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Congress grant excessive legislative discretion to the Commission?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> In determining what Congress may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the government co-ordination. So long as Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Sentencing Guidelines are constitutional, since Congress neither (1) delegated excessive legislative power to the Commission nor (2) violated the separation-of-powers principle by placing the Commission in the Judicial Branch, by requiring federal judges to serve on the Commission and to share their authority with nonjudges, or by empowering the President to appoint Commission members and to remove them for cause. The Constitution's structural protections do not prohibit Congress from delegating to an expert body within the Judicial Branch the intricate task of formulating sentencing guidelines consistent with such significant statutory direction as is present here, nor from calling upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of the Judicial Branch in creating policy on a matter uniquely within the ken of judges.</li>

#### Multiple Layers of Tenure Protection
#### Case: *[Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> 15 U.S.C.S. §§ 7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) were held to be unconstitutional and invalid because the multilevel protection from removal of members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was contrary to U.S. Const. art. II's vesting of the executive power in the President and contravened the Constitution's separation of powers.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Free Enterprise Fund, a non-profit organization, brought suit challenging the constitutionality of Title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It alleged that the creation of the Public Company Oversight Board (the Board) by the Act violated the Appointments Clause because it deprived the President from exercising adequate control over the Board. However, the Board itself was under the direct supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), all of whose commissioners are appointed by and can be removed by the President.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the statutes providing for judicial review of Commission action prevent the District Court from considering petitioners' claims?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Provisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review unless the statutory scheme displays a fairly discernible intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within the statutory structure. But courts presume that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review; if the suit is wholly collateral to a statute's review provisions; and if the claims are outside the agency's expertise. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members contravened the Constitution's separation of powers. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act not only protected Board members from removal except for good cause, but withdrew from the President any decision on whether that good cause existed. That decision was vested instead in other tenured officers--Securities and Exchange Commissioners--none of whom was subject to the President's direct control. The result was a Board that was not accountable to the President, and a President who was not responsible for the Board. The unconstitutional tenure provisions were severable from the remainder of the statute. Concluding that the removal restrictions imposed by 15 U.S.C.S. §§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) were invalid left the Board removable by the Commission at will, and left the President separated from Board members by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remained fully operative as a law with those tenure restrictions excised. The Appointments Clause challenges had no merit</li>

#### Congressional War and Treaty Powers, and the Implied Power over Foreign Affiars

#### Case: *[Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Injunctive relief against a landlord under the Housing and Rent Act was proper. Congress, in enacting the law, was authorized to control rents even after the cessation of hostilities, in order to control the deficits in housing created by war.  </li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Housing and Rent Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 349, became effective on July 1, 1947. The following day, the landlord demanded of its tenants increases of 40 percent and 60 percent for rental accommodations in a city defense-rental area. That was an admitted violation of the Act and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. The housing expediter thereupon instituted the proceeding under § 206(b) of the Act to enjoin the violations, and a preliminary injunction was issued. The injunction was reversed after a hearing. On appeal, the Court reversed. The Court held that the war power sustained the legislation.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the continuation of the rent control by the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, enacted after the termination of hostilities, a valid exercise of the war power?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Section 204(b) (28 U.S.C.S. § 349(a)) of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947 provides that no person shall demand, accept, or receive any rent for the use or occupancy of any controlled housing accommodations greater than the maximum rent established under the authority of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, and in effect with respect thereto on June 30, 1947.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the war power sustained the legislation. The legislative history of the Act made abundantly clear that there had not yet been eliminated the deficit in housing that, in considerable measure, was caused by the heavy demobilization of veterans and by the cessation or reduction in residential construction during the period of hostilities. Since the war effort contributed heavily to that deficit, Congress had the power even after the cessation of hostilities to act to control the forces that a short supply of the needed article created.</li>

#### Case: *[Missouri v. Holland](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A State's constitutional challenge to a federal migratory bird treaty was dismissed because, in pursuance of a valid treaty, the federal government had the authority to not only make treaties but also regulate migratory birds.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The State brought a bill in equity, which challenged the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, 40 Stat. 755, and the regulations made by the Secretary of Agriculture in pursuance of the same, claiming that the treaty was an unconstitutional interference with appellant's sovereign rights under the 10th Amendment , which included absolute control of wild game and birds within the State's borders. The State also alleged a pecuniary interest, as owner of the wild birds within its borders. The district court dismissed the action on the ground that the act of Congress was constitutional. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the Court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that the power to make the treaty had been expressly delegated to the United States under U.S. Const. art. II, § 2 and art. VI. The Court noted that the treaty did not contravene any prohibitory words found in the federal constitution, nor was the subject matter, the regulation of migratory birds, forbidden by some invisible radiation from the general terms of the 10th Amendment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Are the treaty and statute considered void as an interference with the rights reserved to the States?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> By U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, the power to make treaties is delegated expressly, and by U.S. Const. art. VI treaties made under the authority of the United States, along with the Constitution and laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, are declared the supreme law of the land. If the treaty is valid there can be no dispute about the validity of the statute implementing the treaty under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, as a necessary and proper means to execute the powers of the government.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The State as we have intimated founds its claim of exclusive authority upon an assertion of title to migratory birds, an assertion that is embodied in statute. No doubt it is true that as between a State and its inhabitants the State may regulate the killing and sale of such birds, but it does not follow that its authority is exclusive of paramount powers. To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed. Wild birds are not in the possession of anyone; and possession is the beginning of ownership. The whole foundation of the State's rights is the presence within their jurisdiction of birds that yesterday had not arrived, tomorrow may be in another State and in a week a thousand miles away. If we are to be accurate we cannot put the case of the State upon higher ground than that the treaty deals with creatures that for the moment are within the state borders, that it must be carried out by officers of the United States within the same territory, and that but for the treaty the State would be free to regulate this subject itself. Here a national interest of very nearly the first magnitude is involved. It can be protected only by national action in concert with that of another power. The subject-matter is only transitorily within the State and has no permanent habitat therein. But for the treaty and the statute there soon might be no birds for any powers to deal with. We see nothing in the Constitution that compels the Government to sit by while a food supply is cut off and the protectors of our forests and our crops are destroyed. It is not sufficient to rely upon the States. The reliance is vain, and were it otherwise, the question is whether the United States is forbidden to act. We are of opinion that the treaty and statute must be upheld. </li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Respondent civilians, each tried by court-martial and convicted of murder, were ordered released from custody. Under the Constitution, the courts of law alone had the power to try civilians for their offenses against the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Following trials by court-martial, several civilians, wives of members of the United States military, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

    <li><b>Issue:</b> Should the civilians be released from custody?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The United States is entirely a creature of the Constitution of the United States. Its power and authority have no other source. It can only act in accordance with all the limitations imposed by the Constitution. When the government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad, the shield, which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution provide, to protect his life and liberty, should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that respondent civilians, each tried by court-martial and convicted of murder, should be released from custody, because under the Constitution of the United States, the courts of law alone had the power to try civilians for their offenses against the United States. The Constitution in its entirety applied to the trials of respondents, and their court-martials did not meet the requirements of U.S. Const. art. III, § 2 or U.S. Const. amends. V and VI. Further, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 14 did not encompass persons who could not fairly be said to be "in" the military service. Respondents, wives of members of the United States military, could not fairly be said to be "in" the military service. Respondents did not lose their civilian status and their right to a civilian trial because the government helped them live as members of a soldier's family. The Court stated that it should not break faith with the nation's tradition of keeping military power subservient to civilian authority, a tradition which was firmly embodied in the Constitution.</li>

#### Case: *[Bond v. United States](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> 18 U.S.C.S. § 229(a), implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act, did not cover a wholly in-state use of an arsenic-based compound and a commonly used photography chemical because Congress had not been utterly clear that it intended to intrude on the principles of federalism inherent in the federal constitutional structure.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner Bond sought revenge against Myrlinda Haynes--with whom her husband had carried on an affair--by spreading two toxic chemicals on Haynes's car, mailbox, and doorknob in hopes that Haynes would develop an uncomfortable rash. On one occasion Haynes suffered a minor chemical burn that she treated by rinsing with water, but Bond's attempted assaults were otherwise entirely unsuccessful. Federal prosecutors charged Bond with, among other things, possessing and using a chemical weapon. Bond moved to dismiss the chemical weapons charges on the ground that the Act violates the Tenth Amendment. When the District Court denied her motion, she pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal. On appeal, the Third Circuit initially held that Bond lacked standing to raise her Tenth Amendment challenge and that the Act was necessary and proper to carry into effect the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction..</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Act violate Bond’s Tenth Amendment rights?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The global need to prevent chemical warfare does not require the federal government to reach into the kitchen cupboard, or to treat a local assault with a chemical irritant as the deployment of a chemical weapon. There is no reason to suppose that Congress, in implementing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, thought otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that because the federal constitutional structure left local criminal activity primarily to the states, judicial precedent generally declined to read federal law as intruding on that responsibility, unless Congress clearly indicated that the law should have had such reach. The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act contained no such clear indication where the general definition of chemical weapon, although defined broadly, was not a clear statement that Congress meant the statute to reach local criminal conduct. The chemicals used by Bond were not of the sort that an ordinary person would have associated with instruments of chemical warfare. Moreover, state laws were sufficient to prosecute petitioner. Thus, § 229 was read consistent with the principles of federalism inherent in the federal constitutional structure. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</li>

### Executive Privileges, Imunities and Congress's Power of Impeachment

#### Case: *[United States v. Nixon](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Executive Privilege did not protect President from complying with third-party subpoena duces tecum because generalized privilege was asserted; prosecution showed specific need for recordings and documents of meeting with persons charged with crimes.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The President of the United States invoked executive privilege to avoid compliance with a third-party subpoena duces tecum that required the production of tape recordings and documents. A special prosecutor sought to obtain information concerning meetings between the President and certain individuals charged with obstruction of justice, conspiracy, and other offenses. The President's motion to quash the subpoena was denied and the court directed the President of the United States to produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to his conversations with aides and advisers. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court of the United States on certiorari.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the President exempt from complying with a subpoena duces tecum?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A subpoena for documents may be quashed if their production would be "unreasonable or oppressive," but not otherwise. A subpoena duces tecum in criminal cases is not intended to provide a means of discovery; its chief innovation is to expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of subpoenaed materials. In order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must show: (1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general "fishing expedition." </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Holding that the President's general privilege of confidentiality did not extend to an absolute privilege of immunity from all judicial process, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the motion to quash. Issues relating to the production of documents in a pending criminal case were justiciable and were properly heard on interlocutory appeal in a case involving the President. Because the special prosecutor had demonstrated a specific need for the evidence sought by way of subpoena and had complied with the requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c), it was proper to compel production and to examine the material in camera. The legitimate needs of the judicial process outweighed executive privilege.</li>

#### Case: *[Nixon v. Fitzgerald](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Petitioner, a former United States President, had absolute immunity from liability based upon official acts; thus, respondent former government employee's suit for retaliatory discharge was dismissed.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondent, a former government employee, filed a suit against petitioner, a former United States President, for retaliatory discharge. After petitioner's motion to dismiss based upon a claim of absolute immunity was denied, petitioner filed a motion for a writ of certiorari. In reversing the lower court's decision, the Court noted that a grant of absolute immunity to the President would not leave the President with unfettered power. The Court stated that there were formal and informal checks on presidential action that did not apply with equal force to other executive officials. The Court observed that the President was subjected to constant scrutiny by the press. It noted that vigilant oversight by Congress would also serve to deter presidential abuses of office, as well as to make credible the threat of impeachment. The court determined that other incentives to avoid misconduct existed, including a desire to earn reelection, the need to maintain prestige as an element of presidential influence, and a President's traditional concern for his historical stature.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the President of the United States entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A former President of the United States is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts. This immunity is a functionally mandated incident of the President's unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by history. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> This case presents the claim that the President of the United States is shielded by absolute immunity from civil damages liability. In the case of the President the inquiries into history and policy, though mandated independently by our cases, tend to coverage. Because the Presidency did not exist through most of the development of common law, any historical analysis must draw its evidence primarily from our constitutional heritage and structure. Historical inquiry thus merges almost at its inception with the kind of "public policy" analysis appropriately undertaken by a federal court. This inquiry involves policies and principles that may be considered implicit in the nature of the President's office in a system structured to achieve effective government under a constitutionally mandated separation of powers. However, the existence of alternative remedies and deterrents establishes that absolute immunity will not place the President "above the law."  For the President, as for judges and prosecutors, absolute immunity merely precludes a particular private remedy for alleged misconduct in order to advance compelling public ends.</li>

#### Case: *[Clinton v. Jones](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The doctrine of separation of powers does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President of the U.S. until he leaves office.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A private citizen sought to recover damages against the President of the United States for actions that allegedly took place before his term began. The President sought a motion to dismiss and argued that in all but the most exceptional cases, the U.S. Constitution requires federal courts to delay such litigation until the President's term ends. The district court denied the motion to dismiss but postponed the trial. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the district court to deny the motion to dismiss and reversed district court's order postponing the trial until the petitioner leaves office. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was it proper for the district court postpone trial?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The district court has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to control its own docket.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court ruled that the doctrine of separation of powers does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President of the United States until he leaves office. When defining the scope of an immunity for acts clearly taken within an official capacity, the Supreme Court has applied a functional approach. Thus, an official's absolute immunity should extend only to acts in performance of particular functions of his office. Immunities are grounded in the nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it.</li>

## The Post-Civil War Amendments and the "Incorporation of Fundamental Rights"

#### Individual Rights Before the Civil War

#### Case: *[Barron v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A wharf owner was not entitled to damages from a city because the Fifth Amendment, which inhibited the taking of private property for public use without just compensation, was not applicable to the legislation of the states.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The city diverted water from its' accustomed and natural course. The alleged consequence was that the water in the harbor was rendered so shallow as to make the owner's wharf useless. The wharf owner brought action against the city to recover damages for injuries to the wharf property. The trial court entered judgment for the owner. The court of appeals reversed, and the owner sought review. The Court dismissed the cause for want of jurisdiction.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the provision in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, declaring that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation, intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the government of the United States and is thus inapplicable to the legislation of the states?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> If amendments to the Constitution contain no expression indicating an intention to apply them to the state governments the court cannot so apply them.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court found that the provision in the Fifth Amendment declaring that private property should not be taken for public use without just compensation was intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the government of the United States and was not applicable to the legislation of the states.</li>

#### Slavery
#### Case: *[Dred Scott v. Sandford](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>  The Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction over a slave's assault action against his owner because the slave was of African descent, and not permitted citizenship under the laws of the United States or of any individual state.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner was a slave of African descent. He brought suit in the federal court against respondent, his owner, for assault. Certiorari was granted from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Missouri finding that respondent was not liable to petitioner for assault. The Court held that petitioner was not a citizen of Missouri as asserted in his original complaint because he was not permitted to become a citizen, and no state had the power to grant him citizenship. The judgment finding that respondent was not liable to petitioner for assault was reversed and the case was remanded with an order to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that petitioner was not a citizen and could not bring the action in the court because petitioner was a slave of African descent.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Circuit Court of the United States have jurisdiction to hear and determine the case between these parties?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The rights of property are united with the rights of person, and placed on the same ground by the Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, and property, without due process of law. An act of Congress that deprives a citizen of the United States of his liberty or property, merely because he came himself or brought his property into a particular territory of the United States, and who has committed no offense against the laws, can hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that petitioner did not gain his freedom by being transferred into a territory of the United States declared free by Congress because Congress's power to make rules and regulations for territories only applied to those territories belonging to the United States when the constitution was drafted. Therefore, the law making the territory free was unconstitutional. Finally, the Court held that petitioner did not gain his freedom by being taken into the free state of Illinois because the property laws of one state could not grant petitioner's freedom. Therefore, the Court held that judgment against respondent was to be vacated and the case dismissed because the Court did not have jurisdiction over petitioner's complaint.</li>

#### The Post-Civil War Amendments

#### Case: *[Slaughter-House Cases](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The dismissal of plaintiff's action was affirmed where a state statute regulating the slaughtering of animals was not unconstitutional since the state had exclusive rights under its police power to regulate such slaughtering.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, butchers of New Orleans, contended that a state statute was unconstitutional in that it violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and U.S. Const. amend. XIII and and an unlawful restraint on the butcher trade. The statute was passed to protect the health of the city and forbade the slaughtering of animals for food within the city, giving a single company the sole privilege of slaughtering animals. Plaintiffs also argued that the statute created a monopoly and deprived the butchers of the city the right to exercise their trade. The state court decided in favor of the company.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the state statute constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The police power extends to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protection of all property within the state; and persons and property are subjected to all kinds of restraints and burdens in order to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the state. Of the perfect right of the legislature to do this no question ever can be made, so far as natural persons are concerned.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the state had the exclusive right under its police power to determine the localities where slaughtering for the city could be conducted, and the laws of the federal Constitution did not apply. Additionally, the law only restricted the butchers as to where they could slaughter, but not from butchering, thus it did not restrain their trade.

#### Case: *[Saenz v. Roe](Link)*

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A statute mandating residency requirements of a certain duration before becoming entitled to receive benefits violated the privileges and immunities clause in improperly discriminating against citizens on the basis of their length of residency.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondents filed suit challenging the durational residency requirements of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, contending that the residency requirements imposed an unconstitutional burden on a certain class of citizens based upon their length of residency. The district court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the statute's implementation after concluding that it placed a penalty on new citizens and failed to treat them on an equal basis with existing residents. After the appellate court affirmed, petitioners sought further review.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can a state limit the availability of welfare benefits to families residing in the state for less than twelve months with regard to the Privileges and Immunities Clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The right to travel embraces at least three different components. It protects the right of a citizen of one state to enter and to leave another state, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second state, and, for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens of that state. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Supreme Court noted the protections afforded to citizens under U.S. Const. amend. XIV imposed a limitation on the states' powers and concluded that the statute impermissibly affected the rights of newly arrived citizens as to the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same state, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The statute discriminated against citizens new to the state, and since the right to travel embraced a citizen's right to be treated equally in his or her new state of residence, the discriminatory classification was itself a penalty.</li>

### The "Incorporation" of the Bill of Rights ThroughThe Due Process Clause

#### Case: *[Palko v. Connecticut](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> State law allowing State to appeal criminal case did not violate Fourteenth Amendment by subjecting defendant to double jeopardy on retrial; retrial did not violate fundamental principles of liberty and justice when ensuring an error-free trial.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant appealed a decision by the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, which sustained a death sentence imposed for first degree murder. Defendant claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. § 6494, which allowed the State to appeal in a criminal case, violated the Fourteenth Amendment because it allowed defendant to be tried twice and thus subjected him to double jeopardy in violation of Fifth Amendment. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Were petitioner's rights violated?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Where the Fourteenth Amendment has absorbed privileges and immunities from the federal bill of rights, the process of absorption has had its source in the belief that neither ordered liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The United States Supreme Court affirmed, holding that not all U.S. Const. amend. V rights were applicable to the states through U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the state could choose not to adopt a right if it was not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty, and its abolishment would not violate a principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of the American people as to be ranked as fundamental. The Court ruled that the state statute did not deny petitioner due process of law because allowing a retrial did not violate fundamental principles of liberty and justice where it was only done to ensure a trial free from substantial legal error.</li>

#### Case: *[Adamson v. California](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A state law that allowed comment on defendant's failure to testify did not violate his right to due process when it was not construed as an admission of the evidence, defendant was presumed innocent, and the burden of proof remained upon the state.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant contended that he could not take the stand to deny the evidence against him because he would be subjected to a cross-examination as to former crimes to impeach his veracity and the evidence so produced could have brought about his conviction. Such cross-examination was allowable in California under Cal. Penal Code § 1323 and Cal. Const. art. I, § 13, and defendant contended that they denied him due process.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The clause of the Fifth Amendment, protecting a person against being compelled to be a witness against himself, is not made effective by the Fourteenth Amendment as a protection against state action because freedom from testimonial compulsion is a right of national citizenship; it is a personal privilege or immunity secured by the Federal Constitution as one of the rights of man that are listed in the Bill of Rights.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The due process clause did not protect defendant's freedom from giving testimony by compulsion in state trials. The Fourteenth Amendment prevented a state from abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, but a state was free to abridge, within the limits of the due process clause, the privileges and immunities flowing from state citizenship. Failure of defendant to testify was not an admission of the truth of the adverse evidence. Instructions told the jury that the burden of proof remained upon the state and the presumption of innocence remained with defendant. Comment on failure to deny proven facts did not in California tend to supply any missing element of proof of guilt.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> In a case where defendant was charged in state court with a misdemeanor simple battery offense that carried a maximum two-year sentence, he was entitled to a jury trial because it was not a petty offense.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant was charged with simple battery, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of two years imprisonment and a $ 300 fine. Defendant sought trial by jury, but because the Louisiana Constitution grants jury trials only in cases in which capital punishment or imprisonment at hard labor may be imposed, the trial court denied the request. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to serve 60 days in the parish prison and pay a fine of $ 150. After the state supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari, defendant sought review in the federal court.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the State of Louisiana obligated to provide a trial by jury in this case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in all criminal cases which, were they to be tried in a federal court, would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that a crime punishable by two years in prison was a serious crime and not a petty offense. Consequently, defendant was entitled to a jury trial and the trial court erred in denying it. In so ruling, the Court opined that the right to trial by jury guaranteed defendants in criminal cases in federal courts by the U.S. Const. art. III and by the Sixth Amendment was also guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to defendants tried in state courts.</li>

    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Second Amendment is incorporated through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and is thus protected from infringement from state or local governments.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and that the Second Amendment was fully applicable to the states. Self-defense was a basic right and was the central component of the Second Amendment right, and the Court had recognized that the Second Amendment right applied to handguns, which were the preferred firearm to keep and use for protection of one's home and family. </li>

### Substantive Due Process & Economic Liberties

#### Case: *[Lochner v. New York](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Law prohibiting employers from allowing employees to work more than 10 hours in one day was an unconstitutional exercise of the state's police powers because it unnecessarily interfered with the contract rights of individuals.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The State of New York enacted a statutes which restricted employers from allowing employees to work more than 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week. The State Supreme Court found that Lochner violated a New York labor law.  The employer allowed his employee, a baker, to work more than 60 hours in one week. The State Supreme Court upheld the labor law as a constitutional exercise of the state's police power. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the Statute limiting employees hours constitute a legitimate exercise of state police powers?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The right to contract ones labor is at the "liberty of the individual" and the State cannot interfere by passing a statute limiting a persons ability to contract. However, the State may still have a legitimate reason to regulate certain industries if the health of the employees is at risk.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The labor law that was enacted was not a legitimate exercise of the police power of the State, but an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right and liberty of the individual to contract, in relation to labor, and as such it is in conflict with, and void under, the Federal Constitution. The statute was not necessary as a health law to safeguard the public health or the health of the individuals who labored as bakers. The trade of a baker was not an unhealthy one to such a degree that would authorize the legislature to interfere with the right to labor and the right of free contract on the part of the individual. Various regulations already governed the cleanliness of the quarters in which bakeries were to be conducted. Restricting the number of hours that a baker could work would not further the purpose of those regulations. It was not possible to discover the connection between the number of hours a baker could work and the quality of the bread that he produced.</li>

#### Case: *[Nebbia v. New York](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendant's conviction for selling milk at a price below that allowed by an order of the state board pursuant to the Milk Control Law was proper as the statute did not discriminate unfairly against defendant or violate his due process rights.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The New York Legislature passed a Milk Control Law that established a Milk Control Board with the power to fix minimum and maximum retail prices charged by stores to consumers for milk. Defendant was a storekeeper who was found to have sold milk for less than the price fixed by the Board's order. Defendant asserted that the statute and order violated the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that the contention that discrimination deprived defendant of equal protection was not well founded because there was no showing that the order placed him at a disadvantage or affected him adversely.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the Federal Constitution prohibit a state from fixing the selling price of milk?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Fifth Amendment, in the field of federal activity, and the Fourteenth, as respects state action, do not prohibit governmental regulation for the public welfare. They merely condition the exertion of the admitted power, by securing that the end shall be accomplished by methods consistent with due process. It results that a regulation valid for one sort of business, or in given circumstances, may be invalid for another sort, or for the same business under other circumstances, because the reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant facts.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The law-making bodies have in the past endeavored to promote free competition by laws aimed at trusts and monopolies. The consequent interference with private property and freedom of contract has not availed with the courts to set these enactments aside as denying due process.  Where the public interest was deemed to require the fixing of minimum prices, that expedient has been sustained.  If the law-making body within its sphere of government concludes that the conditions or practices in an industry make unrestricted competition an inadequate safeguard of the consumer's interests,  produce waste harmful to the public, threaten ultimately to cut off the supply of a commodity needed by the public, or portend the destruction of the industry itself, appropriate statutes passed in an honest effort to correct the threatened consequences may not be set aside because the regulation adopted fixes prices reasonably deemed by the legislature to be fair to those engaged in the industry and to the consuming public. And this is especially so where, as here, the economic maladjustment is one of price, which threatens harm to the producer at one end of the series and the consumer at the other.  The Constitution does not secure to anyone liberty to conduct his business in such fashion as to inflict injury upon the public at large, or upon any substantial group of the people. Price control, like any other form of regulation, is unconstitutional only if arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt, and hence an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty.</li>

#### Minimum Rationality Review of Economic Legislation

#### Case: *[Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Oklahoma statute limiting opticians' ability to fit eyeglass lenses without a prescription from an ophthalmologist or optometrist or to advertise the sale of frames and mounting was a valid exercise of police power based on assumed health concerns.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The optician sought to have Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 59, §§ 941-947 (1951) declared unconstitutional because the effect of § 941 was to forbid an optician from fitting or duplicating lenses without a prescription from an ophthalmologist or optometrist. In practical effect, it meant that no optician could fit old glasses into new frames or supply a lens without a prescription. The trial court found that portions of the statute were unconstitutional. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court held that, although the law might have exacted a needless, wasteful requirement in many cases, it was for the legislature, not the courts, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the new requirement. In reversing the judgment, the Court held that the law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the law's prohibition on the use of advertising for the sale of eyeglasses and lenses was constitutional because the legislature could treat all who dealt with the human eye as members of a profession who should use no merchandising methods for obtaining customers.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The day is gone when the United States Supreme Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought. For protection against abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the polls, not to the courts.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment holding that part of the Oklahoma statute was unconstitutional, and the Court affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</li>

### Substantive Due Process and Privacy

#### Contraception

#### Case: *[Meyer v. Nebraska](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A Nebraska law that prohibited teaching foreign languages to children who had not completed the eighth grade, as an exercise of police power, infringed upon parents' liberty to control their child's education as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff Meyer, a teacher, while working in a parochial school, was convicted for teaching the German language to a 10-year old child who had not successfully passed the eighth grade, in violation of 1919 Neb. Laws ch. 249—a statute that prohibited teaching of languages other than English to children who had not passed the eighth grade. The state supreme court had held that the statute was a valid exercise of the State's police power. Thereafter, Meyer appealed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the statute a valid exercise of the State's police power?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The liberty guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend. XIV denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that the statute was arbitrary and without reasonable relation to any legitimate State goal. The Court further held that the liberty guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV protected the teacher's right to teach and the right of parents to engage the teacher in educating their children. According to the Court, education and acquisition of knowledge were matters of supreme importance that should be diligently promoted. As such, the State could not, under the guise of exercising its police power, interfere with such guaranteed liberty interests. The Court found that, by the statute in question, the legislature was attempting to materially interfere with the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of students to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own children. Thus, the Court ruled that Meyer’s conviction was based on an unconstitutional statute.</li>

#### Case: *[Pierce v. Society of Sisters ](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An act that mandated children's attendance at public schools unreasonably interfered with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the education of their children and with the business interests of private schools threatened with destruction.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Two private primary schools, Society of Sisters and Hill Military Academy filed actions against the Governor of Oregon and other state officials (“appellants”) challenging the constitutionality of the Compulsory Education Act (Act) under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The Act mandated that all normal children aged 8 to 16 years old must attend public school. The schools asserted that their enrollments were declining as a result of the Act. The district court entered an order enjoining the State from enforcing the Act and the State sought review in consolidated appeals. It asserted that since the schools were corporations, it had no amend. XIV rights.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Compulsory Education Act violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Legislation may not unreasonably interfere with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control. Rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution may not be abridged by legislation which has no reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court ruled that the inevitable practical result of enforcing the Act was the destruction of the primary schools and perhaps all other private primary schools for normal children within the state. According to the Court, the Act unreasonably interfered with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of their children. The Court further held that although the schools were corporations, they could claim constitutional protection for their business and property. The Court noted that the corporations sought protection against a present and real threat of injury from the arbitrary, unreasonable, and unlawful interference with their patrons and injunctive relief was proper.</li>

#### Case: *[Skinner v. Oklahoma](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Oklahoma Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act violated the equal protection clause because it laid an unequal hand on those who had committed intrinsically the same offense, larceny and embezzlement, by sterilizing one and not the other.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant, Skinner, was convicted of more than two felonies and, under the Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act (Act), was ordered to be rendered sterile. Skinner claimed that the Act violated the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the Oklahoma Supreme Court affirmed the order that the operation be performed. Defendant was granted certiorari.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Strict scrutiny of the classification which a state makes in a sterilization law is essential, lest unwittingly, or otherwise, invidious discriminations are made against groups or types of individuals in violation of the constitutional guaranty of just and equal laws. The guaranty of equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws. When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offense and sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The judgment of the state supreme court affirming the order for sterilization was reversed.The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Act failed to meet the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court found that defendant was convicted of larceny and that the act treated larceny and embezzlement, intrinsically the same crime and punishable in the same manner, the same except for the sterilization provision. The Equal Protection Clause did not prevent a legislature from recognizing degrees of evil, and the constitution did not require things different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same. However, where legislation laid an unequal hand on those who had committed the same quality of offense, the Equal Protection Clause would be a formula of empty words if such conspicuously artificial lines could be drawn. According to the Court, the crimes of larceny and embezzlement rated the same terms of fines and imprisonment, but when it came to sterilization the pains and penalties of the law were different, which made for invidious discrimination against groups of individuals in violation of the constitutional guaranty of just and equal laws.</li>

#### Case: *[Griswold v. Connecticut](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendants' convictions for violating a law prohibiting the sale, dispensing, or use of birth control drugs or devices to married persons were reversed because the law was held to be unconstitutional as it violated the fundamental right of privacy.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A Connecticut statute made the use of contraceptives a criminal offense. The executive and medical directors of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut were convicted in the Circuit Court for the Sixth Circuit in New Haven, Connecticut, on a charge of having violated the statute as accessories by giving information, instruction, and advice to married persons as to the means of preventing conception. The Appellate Division of the Circuit Court affirmed and its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut. The case was elevated on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the statute violate a couple’s right to privacy?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers in any house in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fifth Amendment in its self-incrimination clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides that the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held right of privacy to use birth control measures was found to be a legitimate one. Thus, finding the statute unconstitutional. It held that marriage lies within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees, which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Thus, such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar that a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms. The very idea of allowing the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.</li>

#### Case: *[Roe v. Wade](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Personal liberty under the Due Process Clause extended to woman's abortion decision, but was subject to regulation aimed at compelling state interests of maternal health and human life potentiality; abortion laws that did not distinguish between early and later abortions and limited legal justification to saving mother's life were unconstitutional.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff Roe, a pregnant single woman, brought a class action challenging the constitutionality of the Texas criminal abortion laws, which proscribed procuring or attempting an abortion except on medical advice for the purpose of saving the mother's life. Hallford, a licensed physician who had two state abortion prosecutions pending against him, was permitted to intervene. The Does, a childless married couple, separately attacked the laws, basing alleged injury on the future possibilities of contraceptive failure, pregnancy, unpreparedness for parenthood, and impairment of the wife's health. A three-judge federal district court, which consolidated the actions, held that Roe and Hallford, and members of their classes, had standing to sue and presented justiciable controversies. Ruling that declaratory, though not injunctive, relief was warranted, the court declared the abortion statutes void as vague and overbroadly infringing the complainants’ Ninth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. On the other hand, the court ruled that the Does' complaint was not justiciable.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Were the Texas criminal abortion laws unconstitutional? </li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> When pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. The law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be capable of repetition, yet evading review.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that state criminal abortion statute that excepted from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, was violative of theU.S. Const. amend. XIV. For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation had to be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the state, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, could, if it chose, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that were reasonably related to maternal health. For the stage subsequent to viability, the state in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life could, if it chose, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it was necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</li>

#### Case: *[Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The Court held that the husband notification provision of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act placed an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion in a large fraction of cases and was unconstitutional.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> At issue are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982: § 3205, which requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed; § 3206, which mandates the informed consent of one parent for a minor to obtain an abortion, but provides a judicial bypass procedure; § 3209, which commands that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband; § 3203, which defines a "medical emergency" that will excuse compliance with the foregoing requirements; and §§ 3207(b), 3214(a), and 3214(f), which impose certain reporting requirements on facilities providing abortion services. Before any of the provisions took effect, the petitioners - abortion clinics and a physician - brought suit against respondents, the governor and others, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982. The District Court held all the provisions unconstitutional and permanently enjoined their enforcement. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, striking down the husband notification provision but upholding the others.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the Court of Appeals correct in its decision to uphold the provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 other than the husband notification provision?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The Court reaffirms Roe v. Wade's essential holding, which has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies that endanger the woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court substantially affirmed the holding of the court of appeals, although it also found that the reporting provision related to husband notification was invalid, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Court applied the doctrine of stare decisis and reaffirmed the essential holdings in Roe v. Wade because that decision was still workable and its factual underpinnings had not changed. In a joint opinion, three Justices rejected Roe's trimester framework and adopted an undue burden test for determining whether State regulations had the purpose or effect of placing substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before viability. The Court agreed that § 3209imposed a substantial obstacle in a large fraction of cases and was invalid. The Court also affirmed the holding the court of appeals that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3202, the medical emergency provision, did not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion right. A plurality of the Court determined that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3214(a)(12) was also invalid because it required a married woman to provide a reason for her failure to provide notice to her husband.</li>

#### Case: *[Gonzales v. Carhart](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Lower courts erred in finding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C.S. § 1531, unconstitutional on its face; the challengers failed to demonstrate that the Act, as a facial matter, was void for vagueness or that it imposed an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner Gonzales, the United States Attorney General, sought certiorari review of judgments from the United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits affirming district court rulings in favor of respondents, abortion doctors and abortion advocacy groups. The rulings found the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C.S. § 1531, unconstitutional on its face and enjoined petitioner from enforcing the Act.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Court of Appeals err in its judgments finding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 unconstitutional on its face?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, that has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it. The State, from the inception of a pregnancy, maintains its own regulatory interest in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child. Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court applied the Casey standard, which included the central premise that the Government had a legitimate, substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life. The Court concluded that this premise would be repudiated if it affirmed the judgments. The Court held that the Act, on its face, was not void for vagueness and did not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth. The Court rejected  Carhart’s contention that the scope of the Act was indefinite. The Act clearly proscribed performing only the intact dilation and evacuation procedure. Further, the Act's scienter requirement narrowed the scope of the Act's prohibition and limited prosecutorial discretion. The restrictions on second-trimester abortions were not too broad because the Act provided specific anatomical landmarks and included an overt-act requirement. The Court also held that the Act's failure to allow the banned procedure's use where necessary for the mother's health did not have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden of the abortion right because safe medical options were available. The Court found that the proper means to consider exceptions was by as-applied rather than facial challenges.</li>

#### Case: *[Whole Women's Health et al. v. Hellerstedt, Commissioner, Texas Department of State Health Services, et al.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.0031(a), which imposed admitting-privileges requirements on abortion providers, and Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 245.010(a), which required abortion facilities to meet surgical center requirements, were unconstitutional; medical benefits did not justify the undue burden on abortion access.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In 2013, the Texas Legislature enacted House Bill 2 (“H.B. 2”), which contained two provisions challenged in this case: the admitting-privileges requirement and the surgical-center requirement. The “admitting-privileges requirement” provided that a physician performing or inducing an abortion must have active admitting privileges at a hospital located not further than 30 miles from the abortion facility. The “surgical-center requirement” required an “abortion facility” to meet the minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers under Texas law. Before the law took effect, a group of Texas abortion providers filed the Abbott case, in which they lost a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the admitting-privileges provision. After the law went into effect, Whole Woman’s Health et al. (“Woman’s Health”), another group of abortion providers (including some Abbott plaintiffs), filed this suit, claiming that both the admitting-privileges and the surgical-center provisions violated the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in another case, Casey. They sought injunctions preventing enforcement of the admitting-privileges provision as applied to physicians at one abortion facility in McAllen and one in El Paso and prohibiting enforcement of the surgical-center provision throughout Texas.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Were the provisions regarding the admitting-privileges requirement and the surgical-center requirement found in the H.B. 2 unconstitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> There exists an undue burden on a woman’s right to decide to have an abortion, and consequently a provision of law is constitutionally invalid, if the purpose or effect of the provision is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability. Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court concluded that a pre-enforcement facial challenge did not have res judicata effect as to an as-applied challenge to the requirement under Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.0031(a) that physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles away. The Court also held that the prior suit did not preclude a challenge to Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 245.010(a), which required abortion facilities to meet surgical center requirements. The Court held that the admitting privileges requirement violated the Fourteenth Amendment as there was no significant health-related problem that the requirement helped to cure, and the resulting closure of facilities placed an undue burden on abortion access. The Court further held that the surgical center requirement was unconstitutional as the record showed that it was unnecessary and would reduce the number of available facilities in the state to seven or eight. The Court reversed the judgment.</li>

#### Supreme Court and Sexuality

#### Case: *[Romer v. Evans](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> State constitutional amendment that drew classification based on sexual orientation not to further a proper legislative end but to make gays unequal to everyone else was unconstitutional; the amendment withdrew only from gays legal protection.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In Colorado, various ordinances were issued, affording protection to persons discriminated against by reason of sexual orientation. To counter these ordinances, voters passed what was known as Amendment 2 in a statewide referendum in Colorado. Amendment 2 prohibited all legislative, executive, or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect homosexual persons. Homosexual persons and certain municipalities who had issued the ordinances commenced litigation to declare Amendment 2 invalid and enjoin its enforcement. The trial court's granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the Amendment failed to satisfy strict scrutiny. The State Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed. It held that Amendment 2 was subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it infringed the fundamental right of gays and lesbians to participate in the political process.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the Colorado Amendment 2 violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The U.S. Const. amend. XIV's promise that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons. Courts attempt to reconcile the principle with the reality by stating that, if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, courts will uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Colorado amendment was invalid as violating the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it put homosexuals in a solitary class with respect to transactions and relations in both the private and governmental spheres, and withdrew from homosexuals, but no others, specific legal protection from the injuries caused by discrimination and forbade reinstatement of these laws and policies. According to the Court, even if homosexuals could find some safe harbor in antidiscrimination laws of general application, the Colorado amendment's prohibition on specific legal protections did not merely deprive homosexuals of special rights, but rather imposed a special disability upon those persons alone. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the Colorado amendment did not bear a rational relationship to any legitimate governmental purpose, such as the state's interests in respect for other citizens' freedom of association, and conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b>  A decision upholding a Texas statute that made it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct was overruled because petitioners were entitled to respect for their private lives.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Responding to a reported weapons disturbance in a private residence, Houston police entered petitioner Lawrence's apartment and saw him and another adult man, petitioner Garner, engaging in a private, consensual sexual act. Petitioners were arrested and convicted of violating a Texas statute forbidding two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. In affirming, the State Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that the statute was not unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanded the case for further proceeding</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The State cannot demean a homosexual person's existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.</li>

#### Case: *[United States v. Windsor](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defense of Marriage Act, which denied recognition of same-sex marriages, was unconstitutional since the disallowance of a surviving-spouse estate tax exemption based on the same-sex marriage of the spouse and the decedent, which was recognized by the state, was a deprivation of the equal liberty of persons that was protected by the Fifth Amendment.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The State of New York recognized the marriage of New York residents Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, who wed in Ontario, Canada in 2007. When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor. Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses but was barred from doing so by § 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), codified at 11 U.S.C. § 7. Section 3 amended the Dictionary Act--a law providing rules of construction for over 1,000 federal laws and the whole realm of federal regulations--to define “marriage” and “spouse” as excluding same-sex partners. Windsor paid $363,053 in estate taxes and sought a refund, which the Internal Revenue Service denied. Windsor filed a refund suit contending that DOMA violated the principles of equal protection incorporated in the Fifth Amendment. While the suit was pending, the Attorney General notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Department of Justice would no longer defend § 3's constitutionality. In response, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House of Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to defend § 3's constitutionality. The District Court permitted the intervention. On the merits, the court ruled against the United States, finding § 3 unconstitutional and ordering the Treasury to refund Windsor's tax with interest. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed. The United States has not complied with the judgment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional for disallowing a tax refund and estate tax exemption for surviving spouses of a same-sex marriage?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> State laws defining and regulating marriage must respect the constitutional rights of persons; but, subject to those guarantees, regulation of domestic relations is an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the states.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The U.S. Supreme Court held that § 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional as a deprivation of the equal liberty of persons that was protected by the Fifth Amendment. The statute was applicable to a wide variety of over 1,000 federal statutes and regulations in addition to the tax exemption, and was directed to a class of persons the state sought to protect by recognizing same-sex marriages, in furtherance of no specific federal policy. The state's decision to give same-sex couples the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import, but the government used the state-defined class for the opposite and improper purpose of imposing restrictions and disabilities. Thus, § 3 of DOMA, which sought to injure the very same-sex class the state sought to protect, violated basic due process and equal protection principles by identifying and making unequal a subset of state-sanctioned marriages.

#### Case: *[Obergefell v. Hodges](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry, and state laws excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage were held invalid; states cannot refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another state on the ground of its same-sex character.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Fourteen same-sex couples, and two men whose same-sex partners were deceased, filed suits in Federal District Courts in their home States, claiming that respondent state officials violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying them the right to marry or to have marriages lawfully performed in another State given full recognition. Each District Court ruled in petitioners' favor, but the Sixth Circuit consolidated the cases and reversed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the state officials violate the Fourteenth Amendment by denying same-sex couples the right to marry?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. Same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972) must be and is overruled, and Mich. Const. art. I, § 25, Ky. Const. § 233a, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 3101.01 (2008), and Tenn. Const. art. XI, § 18 are held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held that under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. Laws of Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee were held invalid to the extent they excluded same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples. Because same-sex couples can exercise the fundamental right to marry in all states, it follows that there is no lawful basis for a state to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another state on the ground of its same-sex character. The Court reversed the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.</li>

#### Supreme Court and Medical Care Deicions

#### Case: *[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept of Health](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Petitioner parents' request to withdraw their vegetative daughter's feeding and hydration equipment was denied where there was no clear and convincing evidence of patient's desire to have life-sustaining treatment withdrawn.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner Nancy Cruzan is incompetent, having sustained severe injuries in an automobile accident, and now lies in a Missouri state hospital in what is referred to as a persistent vegetative state: generally, a condition in which a person exhibits motor reflexes but evinces no indications of significant cognitive function. The State is bearing the cost of her care. Hospital employees refused, without court approval, to honor the request of Cruzan's parents, copetitioners here, to terminate her artificial nutrition and hydration, because that would result in death. A state trial court authorized the termination, finding that a person in Cruzan's condition has a fundamental right under the State and Federal Constitutions to direct or refuse the withdrawal of death-prolonging procedures, and that Cruzan's expression to a former housemate that she would not wish to continue her life if sick or injured unless she could live at least halfway normally suggested that she would not wish to continue on with her nutrition and hydration. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the right to refuse treatment embodied in the common-law doctrine of informed consent, applicable in this case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law. This notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical treatment. Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages. The informed consent doctrine has become firmly entrenched in American tort law. The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent, that is, to refuse treatment.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court affirmed the judgment denying a court order directing the withdrawal of petitioners' daughter's artificial feeding and hydration equipment because the U.S. Constitution did not require the state to repose judgment on matters concerning the right to refuse treatment with anyone but the patient herself. It said that the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, did not require the state to repose judgment on matters concerning the right to refuse treatment with anyone but the patient herself. The Court held that a state could choose to defer only to the patient's wishes rather than confide the decision to close family members.</li>
