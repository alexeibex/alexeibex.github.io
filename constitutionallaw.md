### 1.4 Authority & Role of the Supreme Court

#### 1.4.1 The Power of Judicial Review

Does the Court have the final word in constitutional interpretation? Both Congress and the executive branch also interpret the Constitution, but whose say is final?

1. Adams had issued and signed an order appointing Marbury a justice of the peace. Marshall, then Secretary of State, failed to deliver it before the end of the Adams administration. Jefferson and Madison, the new Secretary of State, refused to deliver it. Marbury sued in December 1801 to receive the commission.
2. The “peculiar delicacy” of the case was its contentious political context and the impact of the Court’s decision on the relations between the branches of government. Madison’s failure to appear in court resulted from the controversy.
