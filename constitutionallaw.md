### 1.4 Authority & Role of the Supreme Court

#### 1.4.1 The Power of Judicial Review

Does the Court have the final word in constitutional interpretation? **Both Congress and the Executive Branch** also interpret the Constitution, but whose say is final?

##### Historical Context of Judicial Review
1. Adams had issued and signed an order appointing Marbury a justice of the peace. Marshall, then Secretary of State, failed to deliver it before the end of the Adams administration. Jefferson and Madison, the new Secretary of State, refused to deliver it. Marbury sued in December 1801 to receive the commission.
2. The “peculiar delicacy” of the case was its contentious political context and the impact of the Court’s decision on the relations between the branches of government. Madison’s failure to appear in court resulted from the controversy.


<b>Case: <i>[Marbury v. Madison](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/c36871a6-f343-4439-92c2-c20a624e1549/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Even though an applicant had a legal right to his appointment as justice of the peace, he was not entitled to a mandamus because the act giving the U.S. Supreme Court authority to issue a mandamus to an officer violated the Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Did Marbury have a right to the commission?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> The commission was complete when the President signed it and the Secretary of State affixed the U.S. seal.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to the commission, did he have right to a legal remedy? When can courts review the executive’s actions?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes.</b> Acts “in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion . . . are only politically examinable” i.e., they are beyond judicial review. <b>BUT</b> when the act arises under a legal duty, “<b>and individual rights</b> depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . ”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The Rule of Law: <i>“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”</i> Compare to Louis XIV: “The State, it is I.”</li>
                <li>The question of whether an officer as an individual has a vested right in his appointment, and therefore whether the President can remove him at will, is for the courts. Therefore the courts can review Marbury’s dispute.</li>
                <li>Whether a right is vested is a question for the courts to decide and is not coferring <b>the political question doctrine</b>.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>If Marbury had a right to a remedy, was it a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court? Can the Court enforce the remedy? Can the Court declare a statute to be unconstitutional? Why?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system, authorized the Supreme Court to issue mandamus to lower courts or officials. Madison was an official, so mandamus was unavailable only if the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
              <li>Marshall: "The Constitution granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in only two types of cases (those involving ambassadors, etc., and those in which a state is a party). The Constitution’s division of the Court’s jurisdiction between original and appellate meant that it did not intend to give Congress the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction.</li>
              <li>Congress therefore did not have the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction. <b>§13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</b></li>
              <li><b>Constitutional Supremacy</b>(LINK): the Supremacy Clause established the Constitution as the “supreme law of the land.” so verse the statute, the constitution holds power</li>
              <li><b>Judicial Review (LINK):</b> Limited government requires the Court to review the constitutionality of statutes. <b>“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</b></li>
            </ul>
      </ol>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Supreme Court's jurisdiction was given by statute. Interpretation of the statute allowed for jurisdiction but also brought it into conflict with the Constitution.</li>
        <li>Courts have the ability to judge cases that "arise under" the Constitution.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>Jefferson calls holding "dictum" because the case was dismissed. Not binding law.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

##### Theories of Judicial Review
1. Judicial interpretation: First or Last Word?
   - Is the court’s role mainly to legitimize the national government’s actions or to invalidate them?
2. Judicial supremacy and judicial finality
   - Do other branches have to accept Court decisions as authoritative (judicial supremacy)? Does the court get the last word, or do other branches also have the authority to interpret the Constitution (judicial finality/exclusivity)?
3. Departmentalism:
  - Each Branch of government can interpret the constitution.

##### Frameworks of Beneath the Theories of Judicial Review
1. Functionalism
  - The Court’s actions contribute to maintaining a certain kind of American polity. Judiciary represents, "We The People" as a check on Congress and the Executive Branch.
2. Originalism and Textualism
 - The Court acts on the framers’ intent or on its reading of the text itself.



#### 1.4.2 Supreme Court Authority to Review State Court Judgements
Vertical Power over the states.
"The Constituion bristols with limits over states..."

###### Judiciary oversees interactions within the federal government and between the federal government and the states.
  - The Court rejects the dual soveriengty idea and replaces it with interlocking oversight.



<b>Case: <i>[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/b6a39380-672b-4b93-8fdb-f7bb6d7d8c42/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> The Supreme Court of the United States had appellate power over a final judgement from a state court of appeals because the matter concerned an issue arising under a treaty of the United States.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff appealed from the Court of Appeals of Virginia which found for defendant in plaintiff's action of ejectment, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed. The court of appeals refused to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court because it determined that the appellate power of the Supreme Court did not extend to the state court of appeals. The case was once again brought to the Supreme Court on writ of error.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the Supreme Court of the United States has appellate jurisdiction over the state court of appeals.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial power of the United States, except in courts ordained and established by itself; and if in any of the cases enumerated in the constitution, the state courts did not then possess jurisdiction, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (admitting that it could act on state courts) could not reach those cases, and, consequently, the injunction of the constitution, that the judicial power "shall be vested," would be disobeyed. It would seem, therefore, to follow, that congress are bound to create some inferior courts, in which to vest all that jurisdiction which, under the constitution, is exclusively vested in the United States, and of which the supreme court cannot take original cognizance. They might establish one or more inferior courts; they might parcel out the jurisdiction among such courts, from time to time, at their own pleasure. But the whole judicial power of the United States should be, at all times, vested either in an original or appellate form, in some courts created under its authority.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Appellate jurisdiction is over the case not the court. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over cases that involve any of the enumerated issues (SMJ) outlined in Article 3 of the Constitution. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> The Court’s power to review state court decisions and the constitutionality of state court decisions is well established. See §25 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789</li>

</ul>

</details>



#### 1.4.2.1 Supreme Court Review of State Criminal Cases
*"The judicial power extends to all cases arising under the constitution or a law of the United States, whoever may be the parties"* - Marshall

Power granted by §25 of the 1789 Judiciary act

<b>Case: <i>[Cohens v. Virginia](Link)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Criminal charges decided on the merits against ∆ selling DC lottery tickets in violation of Virgina Law. Supreme Court had jurisdiction to review state judgements.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether the Supreme Court can hear Criminal Cases from the State and Local Governments.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> State judges are more susceptible to state legislatures. State itself was a party to the case, as a result Supreme Court has jurisdiction under the Constitution.</li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

#### 1.4.3 Judicial Exclusivity
*"It is emphatically *the province* and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is"* - Marshall

##### Supreme Court Decision Are Binding
- Supreme Court are the "Keepers of the Flame" of the Constitution
- Opinion written by all 9 justices.

<b>Case: <i>[Cooper v. Aaron](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-cooper-v-aaron.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Following Brown v. Board of Ed, Arkansas Governor refused to allow for desgregation. Case arose out of school board seeking postponement of desgregation. District court granted because of "chaos, bedlam, and turmoil" The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to all action of a state denying equal protection of the laws, whatever the agency of the state taking the action; moreover, the Constitution was the supreme law of the land.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Should the program for desegregation be postponed?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> No state legislator or executive or judicicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Constiution is the Supreme Law of the Land</li>
      <li>The Supreme Court's job is to say what the Law is</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's word is supreme</li>
      <li>Supreme Court's decisions are the Supreme Law of the Land.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Critique of Cooper distinguishing the Constitution v. What the Supreme Court says about the Constitution in its decisions.</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court Interpretations of the Constiution may not be overruled by an Act of Congress

Supreme Court is the final word on Constiutional interpretation

<b>Case: <i>[Dickerson v. United States](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-dickerson-v-united-states.aspx)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Denial of petitioner's motion to suppress was reversed, since Miranda had announced a constitutional rule that could not be superseded legislatively, and the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. Miranda being a Constituional decision cannot be overruled by an act of Congress.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> May Miranda, being a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Miranda and its progeny in the Supreme Court govern the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court reversed, finding that Miranda was a constitutional decision of the court, and therefore could not be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress. Further, following the principles of stare decisis, the court declined to overrule Miranda itself. The court held that Miranda and its progeny governed the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts. </li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

##### Supreme Court over the Executive Branch

Judiciary set its own limits on the executive branch. Only has jurisdiction over executive agents in certain situations.
Big bark but no bite? Presidents will obey orders of court but generally talk a big game.

- Jefferson: *"Co-ordinate branches should be checks on each other, but for the Legislative & Executive in their spheres would make the judiciary a despotic branch"*
- Jackson: *"The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges, and on that point the President is independent of both."*
- Lincoln
- Roosevelt

#### 1.4.4 Political Restraints on the Supreme Court

##### 1. Judicial Selection: The Nomination and Confirmation Process
<details>

<ul>
  <li>Justices nominated by the President but Article 2 provides that the appointment will not be effective unless the President obtains the *"Advice and Consent of the Senate"*</li>
  <li>Prior to new deal era, Senate only rejected on grounds of inompetence or defects in character or temperment.</li>
  <li>People elect the President and the Senate, ergo they can help guide judicial appointments through indirect control</li>
</ul>

</details>

##### 2. Impeachment: Justices appointed to the court *"to hold their Offices during good Behaviour"* (Article 3)

<details>
<ul>
  <li>Presumed to confer life tenure</li>
  <li>May be removed from office on Impeachment for and "Conviction of Treason, Bribery or other High Crimes & Misdemeanors" (Article 2)</li>
  <li>Ideological disagreement with a sitting Justice is not a proper ground for impeachment.</li>
</ul>
</details>

##### 3. Structural Interference: Congress sets the size of and budge for the Court.
  - Executive Court Packing
  - Justice salaries cannot be diminished during their Continuance in Office (Article 3)
  - Potential source of political checking power

##### 4. Jurisdiction-Stripping
  - Congress has the power to make "exceptions" to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. (Article 3)

##### 5. Constitutional Amendment
  - Article 5 permits amendment of almost every provision (Article 5)
  - 2 Methods for initiating the amendment process:
    1. Congress, by a ***2/3rds*** vote may propose amendments for ratification by ***3/4ths*** of the states
    2. OR ***2/3rds*** of the states may apply to Congress to call a constitutional convention for "Proposing Amendments"
    - Amendments to overturn specific Supreme Court rulings have been ratified only 4 times since founding.
      - **(11th, 14th, 16th, 26th)**

#### 1.4.5 Political Questions & The Political Thicket (Limits)
*"Questions, in their nature political, or which are, by the Constitution and laws, submitted to the executive can never be made in this court"* - Marshall

##### Limits on Court:
  - "A case or controvery ***(must)*** arises under the Constituion"
  - Limits on Political Questions that the Court can hear
  - Will not do advisory opinions
  - Will not do cases where parties have no standing
  - Will not do cases that are too old or too soon
  - Will not do cases that are moot

#### Political Question Doctrine:

***The Supreme Court does not resolve political questions.***
Those questions are resolved through the political process.
1. That some matters are committed to the unreviewable discretion of the political branches, AND
  - Constitutional interpretation
2. That some otherwise legal questions ought to be left to the other branches as a matter of prudence.
  - Judicial Discretion

  <li><b>Overview:</b> Voters' complaint against state officers and election officials alleging that a state statute arbitrarily appointed representatives without any logical or rational formula presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, residents of several counties, filed a complaint against defendants, state officers and election officials, alleging that a state statute arbitrarily and capriciously appointed representatives without reference to any logical or rational formula and that it deprived them of the equal protection of the laws in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the District Court may declare a malapportionment legislature unconstitutional without raising a political question.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> A federal court cannot pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because it is irreconcilable with the United States Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed and remanded, holding that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which plaintiffs were entitled to a trial and a decision. The right that plaintiffs asserted was within the reach of judicial protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>

#### Case: *[McCulloch v. Maryland](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The state had no power, by taxation or otherwise, to burden the Bank of the United States because to do so would be repugnant to the supremacy of the laws enacted by Congress.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The state of Maryland sued McCulloch to recover certain penalties under the act of the legislature of Maryland, which imposed a tax on all banks in the state of Maryland not chartered by the Maryland legislature. McCulloch, a cashier at the Bank of the United States, had issued notes that were not issued on stamped paper in the manner prescribed by the state act. The county court found for the State, and the court of appeals affirmed. The cause was brought, by writ of error, to the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Act.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the said act of the General Assembly of Maryland constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The sound construction of the Constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court reversed the holding that the act to incorporate the Bank of the United States was a law made in pursuance of the Constitution. Moreover, the Court held that the law imposing a tax on the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional and void because the states had no power to burden the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>

#### Reserved Powers States v. Federal Government
#### Case: *[U.S Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> State's legislative attempt to impose term limits upon eligible candidates for Congress, limiting candidates to three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate, violated the U.S. Constitution.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The people of Arkansas voted to amend the state constitution to impose term limits upon the individuals it elected to Congress. Ark. Const. amend. LXXIII limited persons seeking office in the House of Representatives to three terms and in the Senate to two terms. Respondent challenged the amendment and the trial court held that it was unconstitutional. The state supreme court upheld that ruling stating that states have no authority to change, add to, diminish the requirements of the Qualifications Clauses, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 2, Art. I, § 3, cl. 7. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the amendment unconstitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power to add qualifications is not within the original powers of the states, and thus is not reserved to the states by the U.S. Const. amend. X. Even if states possessed some original power in this area, the framers intended the Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress, and that the framers thereby divested states of any power to add qualifications.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The US Supreme Court upheld the lower court rulings because any changes with respect to term limits must be made, not by legislation, but rather through the amendment procedures set forth in the U.S. Constitution.</li>

#### Case: *[U.S v. Comstock](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-united-states-v-comstock-664160383.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> In November and December 2006, the Government instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the five respondents in this case. Three of the five had previously pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child pornography, and a fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor. With respect to each of them, the Government claimed that the respondent was about to be released from federal prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to others. During that same time period, the Government instituted similar proceedings against the fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial. Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil-commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, criminal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the Sixthand Eighth Amendments. They also claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution, including those granted by the Commerce Clauseand the Necessary and Proper Clause. The district court granted respondent inmates' motion to dismiss finding that in enacting § 4248, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal. Certiorari was granted on the request of the U.S.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the Congress exceed its powers granted to it by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution when it enacted the statute?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> 18 U.S.C.S. § 4248 is reasonably adapted to Congress' power to act as a responsible federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement constitutionally enumerated authority). Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them to have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct, 18 U.S.C.S. § 4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high danger to the public if released. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Fourth Circuit's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The Court held that Section 4248 was a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related mental-health statutes that had existed for many decades, aside from its focus on sexually dangerous persons. The desire to address the specific challenges identified with mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoners, taken together with U.S. responsibilities as a federal custodian with the constitutional power to act to protect communities from the danger its prisoners could pose, satisfied a rational means review. Powers granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause were, by definition, not powers "reserved to the States" under U.S. Const. amend. X, and, § 4248 even required accommodation of state interests. Section 4248 was not too sweeping in scope. From the implied power to punish, the federal civil-commitment power was inferred.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>


- Necessary & Proper
  - Congress has broad authority to enact federal legislation that is convenient or useful or conducive to the authority's beneficial exercise.
  - **Test for Necessary & Proper:**
    1. Look to see whether statute constitutes a means that is **rationally related** to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power
    2. Modest addition to a set of federal prison related mental health statutes.
    3. Federal Government is the custodian of its prisoners and has the consitutional power to act in order to protect nearby and other communities from the danger federal prisoners may pose.
    4. Statute properly accounts for state interests
    5. the links between §4248 and an enumerated Article 1 power are not too attenuated.
  - Taken together the statute is a necessary and proper means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others.

## 3.0 The Commerce Power and Its Federalism Based Limits
- Article 1 § 8 granted Congress the power to
  - Regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and amonth the Several States, and with the Indian Tribes.
- Central purpose to suppress the "interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States"
- Goal to help end hostile state restrictions, retalitory trade regulations, and protective tariffs on imports from other states...

### 3.1 Commerce Power Before the New Deal
- Marshall gave an expansive interpretation to the Commerce Clause in early 19th century.
  - NY legislature granted Livingston and Fulton, exclusive right to operate steamboats in NY waters.

#### Case: *[Gibbons v. Ogden](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' to navigate steamboats in waters of the United States, and the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the state was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A state act gave an exclusive right to certain individuals to use steam navigation in all the waters of New York for 30 years from 1808. An injunction was issued restraining defendants from navigating steamboats in the waters within the state because of this exclusive privilege, which defendants violated. Defendants contended that the privilege violated an act of Congress which regulated the licensing of ships and vessels in the coasting trade and fisheries and was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The state court found in favor of the plaintiff, and defendants appealed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the law of the state of New York prohibiting navigation in the waters of the state valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>
    In regulating commerce with foreign nations, the power of Congress does not stop at the jurisdictional lines of the several states. The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, is that of the whole United States. Because Congress has the power to regulate commerce, that power must be exercised whenever the subject exists. If a foreign voyage may commence or terminate at a port within a state, then the power of Congress may be exercised within a state.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed, finding that the act of Congress gave full authority to defendants' vessels to navigate the waters of the United States. The law of the state of New York, prohibiting the vessels from navigating the waters of the state, was repugnant to the Constitution and void.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    - Commerce undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is intercourse.
    - The Commerce power is the power to regulate, that is to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.

#### Judicial Limits on the Commerce Power
- 3 Principal judicial approaches
  1. Direct v. Indirect Test
    - Whether the regulated activity had a **direct** or **indirect** effect on interstate commerce
      - "Manufacturing" does not extend to regulation under the Commerce Clause
      - Regulation of commerce applies to the subjects of commerce and not to matters of internal police.
  2. The "substantial economic effects" Test
    - Emphasizing the practical physical or economic effects of the regulated intrastate activities on interstate commerce.
      - Railroad Regulation: Authority to regulate intrastate rail rates that discriminated against interstate railroad traffic.
      - Necessarily embraces the right to control their operations in all matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic.
  3. The Stream of Commerce test
    - Local activities could be regulated by Congress because they could be viewed as themselves "in" commerce or as an integral part of the "current of commerce".
      - Price fixing meat dealers





#### Case: *[Hammer v. Dagenhart](Link)*
- The power to prohibit commerce depends on the harmful nature of the pro- hibited trade. Lotteries, for instance, are a “widespread pestilence” and there- fore fall within Congress’s regulatory authority. Champion. But child labor does not. Moreover, Congress does not have the authority to prevent unfair competition between states.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A federal act, which prevented interstate commerce in the products of child labor, was unconstitutional because the act exceeded congress' authority under the Commerce Clause and invaded the states' reserved powers.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Congress enacted the Act of Sept. 1, 1916, which prevented interstate commerce in the products of child labor. Appellee father filed a bill to enjoin the enforcement of the Act, and the district court granted the bill and declared the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court upheld the district court's judgment, holding that the Act attempted the federal government's regulation of a matter that was purely local.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the contested legislation beyond the scope of authority of Congress?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The production of  goods and the mining of coal are not considered commerce, and are therefore not under Congressional power to regulate. The regulation of production is a local power reserved to States and is Constitutionally protected by the Tenth Amendment. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that although there should be limitations upon the right to employ children in mines and factories in the interest of their own and the public's welfare, such regulation was reserved for the states. The grant of power to Congress over the subject of interstate commerce was to enable it to regulate such commerce, and not to give it authority to control the States in their exercise of the police power over local trade and manufacture.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Key question: “Is it within the authority of Congress in regulating commerce among the States to prohibit the transportation in interstate commerce of manufactured goods” produced with child labor.</li>
        <li>The government (Hammer, the DA for the Western District of North Carolina) argued that Congress was within its Commerce Clause authority. The government argued that the Commerce Clause automatically gives Congress the power to prohibit interstate trade of “ordiary commodities.” The Court disagreed, holding that the power to prohibit depends on “the character of the particular subjects dealt with.” For instance, in Champion, Congress’s authority rested on the harmful effects of lotteries. But “this element is wanting in the present case.”</li>
        <li>The government argued further that regulation was necessary to prevent states that allowed child labor to gain unfair trade advantages over states with child labor restrictions. The Court held that Congress has no power “to require the States to exercise their police power so as to prevent possible unfair competition.” Under any other result, “all freedom of commerce will be at an end, and the power of the States over local matters may be eliminated and thus our system of government be practically destroyed.”</li>

- **Class Discussion**

#### Prisonner’s Dilemmas
1. State economies face a classic prisoner’s dilemma, or race to the bottom: on their own, states will be better off if they cooperate in economic policy, but each has a stronger incentive to defect. So if state A passes a child labor law, its production costs will rise, and state B will gain an economic advantage—but both states would benefit more if they both passes child labor laws.
2. One counterargument is that this is not a true prisoner’s dilemma because states may not agree that child labor laws are best for their citizens.
3. The federal government can provide the necessary centralized coordination to solve this dilemma.

### The Comerce Power and the New Deal
- The government sought to justify measures passed in the New Deal under the Commerce Clause as based on the "substantially affecting commerce" rationale and the "in commerce" rationale
- Tests to the New Deal
  1. Court decided that Congress lacked the power to establish a compulsory retirement and pension plan for all carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act
    - Law was not in purpose or effect a regulation of interstate commerce within the meaning of the Constitution

#### Relaxation of Judicial Constraints on Congressional Power



#### Case: *[NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.](Link)*
- The National Labor Relations Act prohibited employers “from engaging in unfair labor practices affecting commerce.”
  - Jones & Laughlin was accused of violating the act by interfering with employees’ organizing and collective bargaining rights. The Court held that Jones & Laughlin’s activities would have an indirect but significant impact on commerce: “
  - Although activities may be intrastate in character when separately considered, if they have such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control.”


<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> National Labor Relations Board's order requiring employer to cease and desist from unfair labor practices was within its competency, and the National Labor Relations Act was a valid exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The National Labor Relations Board sought their enforcement of an order to employer, which was engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel, to cease and desist from unfair labor practices, to offer reinstatement to 10 employees at one of its plants who were discharged for union activity, to make good their losses in pay, and to post notices. The lower court denied its petition. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. The case was elevated on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the National Labor Relations Act authorized by Congress to regulate interstate commerce?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress to protect interstate commence is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it. Although activities may be intrastate in character, if they have a substantial relation to interstate commerce and their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court ruled that the National Labor Relations Act was a proper exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce, that employees had a right to self-organization, and that discrimination and coercion to prevent exercise of this right was a proper subject for condemnation by legislative authority. The court further ruled that the Act applied to respondent's employees who were engaged exclusively in production because intrastate activities that were closely connected to interstate commerce were subject to regulation by Congress.</li>

#### Case: *[United States v. Darby](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-united-states-v-darby.aspx)*
- The Fair Labor Standards Act prescribed minimum wage and maximum hour requirements for employees engaged in the production of goods re- lated to interstate commerce. Darby, a Georgia lumber manufacturer, was accused of violating the act.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The court reversed the district court's judgment, which had quashed the indictment against appellee on the grounds that the Fair Labor Act of 1938 was unconstitutional, because the restriction on the production of goods for commerce was a permissible exercise of the power under the Commerce Clause.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Fair Labor Standards Act set up a comprehensive legislative scheme for preventing the shipment in interstate commerce of certain products and commodities produced in the United States under labor conditions as respects wages and hours which fail to conform to standards set up by the Act. A lumber manufacturer was charged with violation of § 15(a)(1), (2), and (5) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Act). He sought to quash the indictment on the ground that the Act was unconstitutional. The District Court quashed the indictment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the Congress have constitutional power to prohibit the shipment in interstate commerce of lumber manufactured by employees?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress, having by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.S. § 201 et seq., adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the district court's judgment, which had quashed the indictment against appellee on the grounds that the Fair Labor Act of 1938 was unconstitutional, because the restriction on the production of goods for commerce was a permissible exercise of the power under the Commerce Clause, The court ruled that the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause was plenary to exclude any article from interstate commerce subject only to the specific prohibitions of the Constitution. Further, Congress, having by the Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which did not conform to the specified labor standards, could choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involved control of intrastate activities.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- Part 1 (prohibition of shipment of proscribed goods in interstate commerce under § 15(a)(1)):
  - “ . . . the only question arising under the commerce clause with respect to such shipments is whether Congress has the constitutional power to prohibit them.”
  - The government argued that Congress acted “under the guise of regulation of interstate commerce.” But its real aim was to regulate hours and wages.
  - Held: Congress’s freedom to exercise its commerce clause powers do not depend whether “its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states.” Or: Congress is free to exercise police power via the commerce clause as long as the commerce clause exercise is valid on its own.
  - Hammer v. Dagenhart, which held that Congress’s commerce clause powers were limited to regulation of things with “some harmful or deleterious property,” is now overruled.
- Part 2 (validity of the wage and hour requirements under §§ 15(a)(2), 6, and 7):
  - Darby’s employees were not themselves engaged in interstate commerce. The question was whether employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce were within the reach of Congress’s regulatory power.
  - Congress intended the act not only to prevent transportation of the prohibited product, but also to “stop the initial step toward tranpportation, production with the purpose of so transporting it.”Such regulation was within Congress’s power.
  - Congress also appropriately exercised its commerce clause power in coordinating economic activity between the states by limiting “a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has in effect condemned as “unfair.””

    <li><b>Facts:</b> Pending a referendum vote of farmers upon wheat quotas proclaimed by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, the Secretary made a radio address in which he advocated approval of the quotas and called attention to the recent enactment by Congress of the amendatory act, later approved May 26, 1941. Appellee farmer filed a complaint against appellants to enjoin enforcement against himself of the marketing penalty imposed by amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (Act) for violating the quotas set forth in the law. The Appellee farmer only used the produced wheat for personal use and local consumption. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can Congress regulate intrastate activity under its commerce clause?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The power of Congress over interstate commerce is plenary and complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution. It follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. Hence the reach of that power extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> It is well established by decisions of this Court that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices. One of the primary purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat, and to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market and, if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce. The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon. This record leaves us in no doubt that Congress may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown, if wholly outside the scheme of regulation, would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices.</li>

- Decision: “ . . . even if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce . . .
  - The act in question was meant both to regulate the amount of wheat on the market and “the extent . . . to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs.” If everyone produced personal wheat as Filburn did, it would have a substantial impact on the interstate wheat market. Therefore, personal wheat production was within Congress’s regulatory power under the commerce clause.
    - This was the same argument that justified the insurance mandate in the Affordable Care Act.

#### Post-Hammer
- The Darby court moved away from the Hammer world in which Congress
could only regulate items it saw as “noxious‘in themselves’”
- Does Darby mean that Congress is free to regulate interstate commerce for noneconomic reasons? Or does it mean that courts should not try to discern Congress’s motives as long as the regulation is a valid exercise of its commerce clause power?
- Darby and Wickard, both unanimous, might suggest that Congress enjoyed unlimited powers to regulate the national economy. But both cases involved issues of economic competition where only Congress could solve the coordination problem between states. States may have wanted to implement similar economic regulation but couldn’t because of the prisoner’s dilemma.
