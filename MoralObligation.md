## Moral Obligation Theory
*Mills v. Wyman*
*Webb v. McGowin*
*Edson v. Poppe*
**- Moral Obligation**
  - Past services are not a sufficient consideration for a promise to pay therefor, made at a subsequent time, and after such services have been fully rendered and completed; however, a moral obligation, founded on previous benefits received by the promisor at the hands of the promisee, will support a promise by him.
**- Sufficient Consideration**
  - An express promise for past services rendered without previous request is supported by a sufficient consideration if the services were beneficial, and were not intended to be gratuitous.
  - An act done for the benefit of another without his request is deemed a voluntary act of courtesy, for which no action can be sustained, unless after knowing of the service the person benefited thereby promises to pay for it. However, if the consideration, even without request, moves directly from plaintiff to defendant, and inures directly to defendant's benefit, the promise is binding though made upon a past consideration.
