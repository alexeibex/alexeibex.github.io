  - Overuling *Adkins* & upholding a state minimum wage law for women
  - See *[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish](link)*
3. The Impact of Nebbia and West Coast Hotel

      - See *[Ferguson v. Skrupa](link)*
2. Punitive Damages and a Partial revival of Substantive Due Process
  - Revival of heightened due process review in the area of economic liberty invovles **limitations on punitive damages** in civil cases.

          - Degree of reprehensibility - disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered and the punitive damages award
