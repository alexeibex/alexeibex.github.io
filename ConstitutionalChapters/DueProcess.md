## Due Process
- Natural Law Approach and The Social Contract
  - Constitution has inherent rights to establish justice to promote the general welfare, to secure the blessings of liberty; and to protect their persons and property from violence.
    - See *[Calder v. Bull](link)*
    - See *[Fletcher v. Peck](link)*
- Transition of Due Process from Process to of Substantive
  - Police power of the state included regulation of individual use of proeprty that was **affected with a public interest**
    - See *[Munn v. Illinois](link)*
  - Corporations as "persons" under the 14th Amendment
    - See *[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pac. Railroad](link)*
  - Sustaining a law prohibiting intoxicating bevereges
    - See *[Mugler v. Kansas](link)*
  - Finally, invalidation a state law on substantive due process grounds for violating liberty of contract for law requiring selling of insurance by people that live there.
    - See *[Allgeyer v. Louisiana](link)*

### Substantive Due Process & Economic Liberties
- Liberty as a substantive Due Process
- Methodical Reasoning examining Means & Ends
  - Liberty = Freedom to enter into Contract
    - Extension to Employment Contract
    - Balance against State's Police Power
      - Must not be an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference of the right of the individual
        - Examination of the ends and means
          - Health Law (ok) v. Wealth Laws (no)
    - Anti-Paternalism of Laws against Freedom to Contract and Work.
      - Court insterting its own ideas against the concensus of the legislature
    - Health is a valid police powers but not in the case of bakers.
      - Means of limiting bakers working will improve the baker/ the bread /the community
        - Slippery slope argument to regulate any professional
  - Dissent:
    - Harlan: Ends are reasonable but means are also reasonable in that benefit of the doubt goes to the legislature.
      - Enacting health law is supported by evidence showing that protecting the health of the workers is a valid means of ensuring health
    - Holmes: Libertarian in name only, Constitution does not embody any economic theory. Courts job is to examine reasonablness of the police power.
      - Unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principels as they have been **understood by the traditions of our people and our law.**
  - See *[Lochner v. New York](link)*

#### The Meaning and Implication of Lochner
1. Lochner and the text of the Fourteenth Amendment
  1. Liberty
  2. Due Process of Law
2. Lochner and Legislative Ends
3. Lochner and the Relationship between means and Ends
4. Extensions of Lochner
  - Invalidating labor laws protecting the right to organize unions.
    - See *[Adair v. United States](link)*
  - Holding the law violated due process and the right of personal liberty and the right of private property & make contracts
    - See *[Coppage v. Kansas](link)*
  - Invalidating an OK law treating the manufacture of ice like a public utility requiring a certificate of convenience and necessity as a prerequisite to business entry
    - See *[New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann](link)*
  - Withstanding against Lochner, Oregon law providing that no female shall be employed in any factory or laundry for more than 10 hours during any one day
    - See *[Muller v. Oregon](link)*
    - Extending *Muller* upholding a law establishing a maximum 10-hour work day for factory workers both male and female
      - See [Bunting v. Oregon](link)*
    - Then removing any special solictude for regulations protecting women holding that a DC law prescribing minimum wages for women violated due process.
      - See *[Adkins v. Children's Hospital](link)*
5. Lochner's Flaws
  - Common consensus that *Lochner* was wrongly decided and widely considered a model of judicial overreach.
6. Consitutionalizing an Economic Theory
  - Alabama law criminializing any breach of a labor contract with intent to defraud & establishing a prima facie presumption that any breach had been carried out with fraudulent intent.
    - Holding that compelling laborers to carry out contracts they otherwise wished to breach violated the 13th Amendment's prohibition on "involuntary servitude"
    - See *[Bailey v. Alabama](link)*
7. The Economic Climate of the Great Depression: Lochner and The New Deal
  - Upholding a NY law that set the price of milk to be sold to prevent cut throat competition and price depression.
  - See [Nebbia v. New York](link)*

#### The Demise of Lochner After the New Deal
1. Judicial deference to the means-ends relationship
  - *Nebbia* signfies a shift from Lochner and a much reduced judicial role in examining the means employed in economic regulations.
2. Judicial deference to legislative ends
  - Overuling *Adkins* & upholding a state minimum wage law for women
  - See *[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish](link)*
3. The Impact of Nebbia and West Coast Hotel
  - Rejecting a due process challenge to a federal prohibiton of the interstate shipment of "filled milk"
  - **Carolene Products Footnote 4**
    - Double Standard of Review: Distinguishing cases warranting deference from those in which greater judicial scrutiny might be appropriate.
    - Rational Basis Test: Courts will generally presume that laws are constitutional/valid but the deference would be replaced with "a more searching judicial inquiry" when it is a law that interferes with individual rights, or a law that restricts the ability of the political process to repeal undesireable legislation or a law that discriminates against a "discrete and insular minority"
      - See [United States v. Carolene Products Co.](link)

#### Minimum Rationality Review of Economic Legislation
- Minimum Rationality Review
  - Upholding a statute that prohibited an optician's to fit duplicate lenses without a prescription from an optometrist or an opthemlogist.
  - Williamson shows that so long as the Court can conceive of some legitimate purpose and so long as the law is reasonable, a law will be upheld
  - The â€œday is gone when the Court uses the Due Process Clause to strike down state laws regulatory of business and industrial  conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.
    - See *[Williamson v. Lee Optical Co.](link)*

#### Closer Scrutiny of Economic Classifications
1. Ex Post justifications
  - *Lee Optical Co.* representds an extremely deferential judicial stance both to the legislature's selection of ends and its choice of means to those ends.
  - Deference to legislative judgements
    - Upholding a law prohibiting anyone from engaging in the business of debt adjusting except as an incident to the lawful practice of law
      - See *[Ferguson v. Skrupa](link)*
2. Punitive Damages and a Partial revival of Substantive Due Process
  - Revival of heightened due process review in the area of economic liberty invovles **limitations on punitive damages** in civil cases.
    - Excessive Fines Cluase of 8th Amendment limits disproportionate criminal penalties
    - Court invalidated an award as excessive involving a 2 million dollar punitive damage award for concealed paint touch-up of a new car, compensatory damages for which were assessed at only $4,000.
      - See *[BMW of North American Inc v. Gore](link)*
        - Guideposts:
          - Degree of reprehensibility - disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered and the punitive damages award
          - the difference between the remedy and the civil penalites authorized or imposed in comperable cases
            - Application of Guideposts determines if in violation of the 8th amendment
              - See *[State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co v. Campbell](link)*
