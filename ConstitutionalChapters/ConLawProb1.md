## ConLaw Problem 1

- The Discrimination Cluase exceeds the power of Congress under the Constitution.
  - Rule: Under the Commerce Clause via the Necessary and Proper clause, Congress may regulate anything, conduct or actual things, which have a substantial effect on interstate markets. Congress may also regulate the channels and instrumentalities of commerce.
  - Rule Explaination:
    - Commerce is described as intercourse. (Gibbons)
    - Three Types of Activity are covered under Commerce (Gibbons)
      - Channels of interstate commerce
      - Instrumentalities of Interstate Commerce
      - Activities with a substantial effect on interstate commerce (Wickard)
        - Local activities can qualify if in aggregate they have a substantial effect.
          - Recently however, aggregation can only occur if the activity is not too tangential or an activity that has been traditionally left to the states. (Lopez & Morrison)
        - Congress also cannot regulate inactivity (Sebelius)
  - Analysis
    - Here the thing being regulated is a landlord/tenant decision to renew a lease. The economic activity here would be considered to tangential for Congress to regulate. Similar to Lopez & Morrison. The court has in the past ruled in favor of upholding discrimination clauses under the Commerce Clause. In heart of atlanta where the Court found that a restuarant close to an interstate highway and that utilized interstate ingredients for its BBQ had a substantial enough effect on commerce to uphold a racial discrimination statute. Here however, a small, Brooklyn landlord's activity is wholly intrastate and no where near a state border. SImilar to Lopez or Morrison, the conduct here is too tangential to be considered commerce. The court may consider facts that can show that discrimination based on AIDS status is a prevelant issue that affects commerce, but again like Morrison, the Court may uphold the 10th amendment and deem the law too overreaching in its power against state rights. Landlord tenant laws are hyper localized and specailized and have tradtionally been left to the state governments. Finally, the Court may interpret the landlords conduct as in activity given that she is simply refusing to renew the lease. The Court has found that COngress may not regulate a person's inactivity and here, the landlord is also choosing not to act.





1. Scope of Congressional Authority

- Rule: First, the court will examine whether the activity being regulated is sufficiently within the scope of interstate activity
  - What is the activity in question and is the activity too tangential.
    - The activity in question must have economic value in order to be aggregated and then have a substantial effect on agricultural activity.
  - Does it cross state lines?
  - The activity itself once aggregated must have a "Substantial effect on interstate commerce"

  1. The Discrimination Statute exceeds the power of Congress under the Constitution.
    1. Under the commerce via the necessary & proper clause, Congress may regulate any thing wihch has a substantial effect on interstate markets. Congress may also regulate the channels and instrumentalities of commerce.
    - The activity
      1. Here regulation of a landlords brownstone apartment is not conduct that is too tangential to interstate commerce. The activity itself must have economic value and while housing and real estate is a fundamental economimc activity, the private contracting of individuals and their lease agreements are more akin to the gender violence or gun violence seen in Morrison & Lopez. Here the activity itself being regulated is the conduct of a landlord against a tenant. It does not cross state lines and is entirely intrastate activity. Further, recent revivals in 10th amendment's exclusive zones of dual soveriengty interpretation prvent federal intrusion into areas that have traditionally been left to the purview of the state. Landlord tenant relation are highly localized and regulation requires very narrow and specialized provisions that should not be given to the federal governemnt.
    1. The substantial findings effect

       Begining with Wickard in 1937, the Court has established that Congress has the ability to regulate activity that in aggregate may have a substantial effect on interstate markets.
    3. Recently however, the Court has set limits on what actually is encompassed as an activity or thing. In Lopez, the Court set the distinction that the activity must have economic value in order to aggregate. In Lopez where the court found that gun violence by schools was too tangential to the interpretation of activity understood within the commerce clause. Similarly in Morrison, the court recently found that violence against women was also too tangential to be considered activity under the Commerce clause.
  1. These recent limits on Congressional Commerce Power would make the discrimination act up for interpretation in terms of its constitutionallity. Previously, Court gave deferrence to Congress, and rational basis for interpretation of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause.
