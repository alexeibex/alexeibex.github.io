## Limited Federal Legislative Authority
#### Congress Must Have Implied or Express Powers
- Basic Principle: Congress may act only if there is express or implied authority to act in the Constitution.
  - States may act **UNLESS** prohibited by the Constitution.
- Source: Article 1 of Constitution: All legislative power herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the US, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.
  - Source: 10th Amendment - All powers not delegated to the US by Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the states or the people.
- Evaluating the Constitutionality of any act of Congress
  - 2 Step Process:
    - Does Congress have the Authority under the Constitution to Legislate?
    - Does the law violate another Constitutional provision or doctrine such as infringing on separation of powers or interfering with individual liberties.
  - Only State Government Possess the Police Power

#### The Reality of Broad Federal Powers
- Supreme Court has given Congress **broad** authority to regulate under constitutional provisions such as:
  - Commerce Clause
  - Spending Power
  - Reconstruction Amendments

### McCulloch v. Maryland and the Scope of Congressional Powers
- Scope of Federal Legislative Power and Relationship to State Government Authority
  - Collection of a (state) tax from the (Federal) Bank of the United State
  - Broadly construes Congress's powers and narrowly limits the authority of state governments to impede the federal government.
- See *[McCulloch v. Maryland](link)*


#### Congress's Authority to Create a National Bank
- 4 Arguments made by Marshall
  - Historical Practice established the Power of Congress to create the bank
  - Refute the argument that states retain ultimate sovereignty because they ratified the Constitution and ceding some of their power to the United States.
    - If states were truly sovereign they would have the ability to veto the creation of a bank by US Government
  - Scope of Congressional Powers under Article 1
    - Non-Enumerated Powers - Despite no enumeration of bank, "**It is a consitution we are expounding**"
      - Not all subdivisions are specifically enumerated by Constituiton
      - Constitution != Statute and should be interpreted differently
    - **The House That Jack Built**
  - Necessary and Proper Clause - Article 1 Section 8
    - To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other power vested in this Constitution.
      - Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are **Constitutional**
        - Rejecting the restrictive meaning of *Necessary* instead elect to interpret as useful/desireable, not indespensible or essential.
        - Further placed in Section 8 which expands Congressional Powers instead of section 9 which limits powers
  - Limits: Reaffirming Marbury and the power of judicial review over Congressional Action

#### Constitutionality of Maryland's Tax
- The power to create a bank = the power to preserve its existence.
  - The power to tax involves the power to destroy and the power to destroy renders the power to create useless.

#### Ramifications
- Establishes Federal Government Supreme over State Government
  - States have no authority to negate Federal Actions
- Expands Scope of Congress's Power
- Courts can limit the ability of States to interfere with Federal Activities

### Necessary and Proper Clause
- Reaffirmation of the approach taken in McCulloch under the Necessary and Proper Clause
  - Upholding a Federal Law for Congress to exercise their power to confine indefinitly sexual predators, because it is necessary and proper.
  - Examines whether the means chosen are "reasonably adopted" to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commcerce power or under other power the Constitution grants Congress the authority to impliment.
  - Under Necessary and Proper, Court has power to punish for crimes that it creates and fits in the scope of McCulloch.
  - Must be used in conjunction with a valid exercise of another power of Congress.
    - Rejection of Necesssary and Proper Clause to uphold the individual mandate because it was not a valid use of commerce power

  - See *[United States v. Comstock](link)*

  - Commerce among the states cannot be stopped at the externaml boundry of a state but may be introduced into the interior.
  - Among as states + another state, internal commerce that exists soley in the state is reserved for the state's regulation.
    - Requires case by case approach whether an activity has interstate effects.
    - Necessitates court to decide how direct/substantial the effects must be

  - Does the 10th Amendment Limit Commerce Power of Congress?
    - No - Congress has complete authority to regulate commerce among the several states.
      - Power like all others vested to Congress is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, acknowledges no limitations other than those prescribed in the Constitution.
