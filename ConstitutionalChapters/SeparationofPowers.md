# Separation of Powers

## Executive Assertions of Power
- Inherent Presidential Power
    - Article II - The executive Power shall bevested  in  a  President  of  the  United  States  of  America.”
- 4 Approaches to Presidential Powers
  - See *[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer](Link)*
      1. New Dominant Test: Justice Jackson
        1. **Power At Apex**
          - "when the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate."
          - Level of Power = Express of Implied Grant of Congressional Authority
          - Constitutionality = So long as the power does not violate another constituional provision it will be accepted.
          - Congressional Action = Has Congress Acted?
        2. **Twilight Zone**
          - when the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon  his own independent powers, but there is a **zone of twilight** in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in  which its distribution is uncertain.
          - Level of Power = No Grant or denial of inherent powers + Twilight of concurrent interests
          - Constitutionality = Depends on the imperatives of events and contemporary imperatives. Highly dependant on Situation Context.
          - Congressional Action = Discussion with no action, Any full congress action? Any Reluctance/Eagerness?
        3. **Lowest Ebb**
          - “when  the  President  takes  measuresincompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his poweris  at  its lowest ebb."
          - Because  the  president  is  disobeying  a  federallaw, such presidential actions will be allowed only if the law enacted byCongress is unconstitutional.
          - Level of Power = Express or Implied Denial
          - Constitutionality = Congress's law must be unconstitutional for president to violate federal law OR power is purely, expressly given to Pres by Constitutuion.
          - Congressional Action = Has Congress Acted?
      2. Majority Opinion - Justice Black: **No Inherent Presidential Power**
        - There is no inherent presidential power; the president may act only if there is express constitutional/statutory authority
          - In a written government of limited powers and specifically delegated authority, the idea of "implied" or "inherent" Presidential Authority is inconsistent.
          - Congress MUST give the Executive branch power to act; the power to enforce the laws is just that; **to enforce the laws that are passed**
          - Laws must be passed not just debated
        - Has Congress Acted and Expressly Addressed the subject?
        - Black: This is a job for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its military authorities
      3. Legislative Acountability - **Adverse Possession & Gloss Theory**: Justice FrankFurter
        - Pattern or practice of Executive action without Congressional Challenge.
        - "It is an inadmissibly narrow conception and to disregard the **gloss**" which life has written upon them. In short a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long purused to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to uphold the Consitution, making as it were such exercise of power part of the structure of our government may be treated as a gloss on "executive" Power
      4. Interstitial Executive Power: Justice Douglas
        - The president may act without express statutory or constitutional authority so long as the president is not usurping  the powers of another branch of government or keeping another branch from performing its duties.
      5. Broad Inherent Authority: Dissent: Chief Justice Vinson
        - The executive as  subject  only  to  the  people,  and,  under the Constitution, bound to serve the people affirmatively in cases where the Constitution does not explicitly forbid him to render the service

### Presidential Vetoes
#### Line Item Vetos

- *[Clinton v. New York](Link)*
  - Examining the Constitutionality of a federal statute that created authority for a presidential line-item veto.
  - The statute empowered the president  to  veto  (or  more  precisely  to  “cancel”  particular  parts  of appropriation bills while allowing the rest to go into effect.
  - Executive must take law as he gets it, "Hermtically Sealed"
    - Whole bill or veto the bill.
    - Majority of Positoin
    - Cannot edit the bill (Formal Appraco)
    - Breyer Dissnet
      - Functionality over process.


## Foreign Policy
- Express & Implied Powers over Foreign Policy
- See *[Zivotofsky v. Kerry](Link)*
  - Executive Presidential Powers Analysis of **Lowest Ebb Tier**
    - Executive Alone okay if Congress not.
      1. What does the law do?
      2. Which Presidential Power does the law interfere with?
      3. Has Congress Historically interfered?
      4. What power did Congress have to pass the Law
  - Justice Scalia Dissent: *Constitution gives both President & Congress foreign policy powers; Not exclusive*
    - COngress may make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the President's powers, but hte President *must* take care that COngress's legislation "be faithfull executed"
- See *[United States v. Belmont](Link)*
- Executive Agreements
  - See *[Dames & Moore v. Regan](Link)*
    - Adopting Frankfurter's Adverse Possession Approach
      - Well established these are permitable
      - Congress expressly rejected an amendment which would have served to prevent executive agreements against treaties
      - Executive Power had taken a "gloss from history" - Power adopted from "adverse possession"
- Executive Power over the States Pursuant to Treaty Power


- Executive Power, Immigration, National Security, and Religious Bias
  - Broad & Planery Power so long as facially neutral
  - See *[Trump v. Hawaii International Refugee Assistance Project](link)*
    - Court interprets using a Rational Basis
    - Power over immigration has long been an executive power
      - Executive examination of facts is entitled to the appropriate weight.
    - Dissent: Focus on practical applications of proclomations
      - Statements of Trump before the election

## Presidential Power and the War on Terrorism
- Constitutional Authority: President = The Commander in Chief v. Congress = "Raise and Support Armies and navies"

- Presidential War Powers
  1. Must Take Action
  2. Must send report to the House of Representatives
  3. Termination after 60 days unless Congress has acted to extend or declared war

- Emergency Constiutionalism
  - Linconln's Suspension of Habeas Corpus
    - Taney critical but allows the suspension to continue
  - "All the Laws but one..."
- **Habeas Corpus**, Military Tribunals & Detention and Trial of "Enemy Combatants"
  - See *[Ex Parte Milligan](Link)*
    - Constitution must be followed even in the hardest of times.
  - See *[Ex Parte Quirin](Link)*
    - Enemy combatants can be tried in front of a military tribunal
      - Congress has provided power consistant with the "Law of War"
      - Lawful Combatant = Solider on the battlefield, in uniform, must be treated as PoW & Repatriated after the war
      - Unlawful Combatant = Spies & Sabateurs, blending with civilians, targeting industry and civilians, can be prosecuted for "war crimes" and punished.
  - See *[Johnson v. Eisentrager](Link)*
    - No Habeas Corpus for foreigners abroad utside the United States
  - See *[Rasul v. Bush](Link)*

## Congressional Authority to Restrain and Enable the Executive
- Push and Pull of power between branches
  - The Policy v. Who gets to Make the Policy


### Congressional Control Over the Actions of the Executive Branch
#### Nondelegation Doctrine
  - See *[INS v. Chadha](Link)*
    - Court's first full enocounter with the problem of legislative vetos.
    - Out the window for the legislative veto
    - Procedure is not in line with Constitution
- Last Real Chance Doctrine/ Legislative Mechanism
  - Constitutional Shortcut to avoid lawmaking again
  - Legislative Veto Provision
  - Last clear change v. Saving time
    - No clear expertise
    - Congress can add a provisional mechanism

### Congressional Constraints on Appointment and Removal

- Art. II §2, Cl.2
  - President shall nominate, and by and with the Adivce and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law...

#### Appointment of Executive Officers
- Congress cannot appoint itself
  - See *[Buckley v. Valeo](Link)*

#### Recess Appointments
- See *[NLRB v. Noel Canning](Link)*

#### Removal of Executive Office
- See *[Bowsher v. Synar](link)*
  - Congress cannot give itself the  power  to  remove  executive  officials who are performing executive functions.
  - Justice White Dissent:
    - Functionalist Approach
      - The question to be answered is whether there is a genuine threat of "encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other"

#### Fettering Executive Removal Power
- See *[Myers v. United States](Link)*
  - Myers stands for the broad proposition that any congressional limits on the removal power are unconstitutional.
  - President may remove executive officials at will Unless removal is limited by statute
    - Congress may limit removal by statute if BOTH
      - For an office where independence from the president is desireable
      - the law does not prohibit removal, but merely limits removal to instances where good cause can be shown.


#### The Constitutionality of the Independent Counsel
- See *[Morrison v. Olsen](Link)*
  - Upheld the constitutionality of limits on the president's ability to remove the independent counsel.
    - A "small"
  - Time would prove Scalia Dissent
    - Encroachment of the executive power and against the letter of the Constitution.
      - Who to blame for rogue independent counsel
    - 20 year sunset on law
      - 3 judges chosen to oversee independent counsel = too much power
      - Law was not renewed
#### Aftermath of Morrison
- The Fate of the Independent Counsel
  - Office of Special Counsel
    - Protected against being dismissed by President.
    - Appointed by Attorney General
    - Still Politically Very Powerful

#### Other interbranch appointments
- See *[Mistretta v. United States](link)*
  - Survival of the US Sentencing Commission
  - Creature of Congress establishing sentencing guidelines

    - Society has gotten so complex, Congress is okay to vest its power
  - Dissent
    - Junior Varsity Congress
      - Commission/Agency is doing Congress's job
        - Violation of Constitution

#### Multiple Layers of Tenure Protection
- See *[Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board](link)*
  - 5-4 Split upholding Presidential Power

### Congressional War and Treaty Powers, and the Implied Power over Foreign Affiars
  - Early Trend was that treaties and War allowed Congress more power
  - Modern Court has begun to resist the notion. No blank check because of war/treaties
  - Congress granted certain powers over war and treaty isues traditionally under executive control.
    - Federal Government Control over basic things
      - Rent Control after the War
      - See *[Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co.](link)*
    - Federalism Issue
      - War may swallow up all powers of Congress but also obliterate 9th and 10th amendment as well.
      - Justice Jackson Agreed with Result but differed on Argument
        - Credible argument for Commerce Clause via *[Wickard](Link)*
- Treaty Powers
  - Treaty to Protect Migratory Birds and States will not interfere with Birds.
  - Congress has the ability to do things outside the norm, if treaty is valid, no dispute that validity of statute over states.
  - See *[Missouri v. Holland](Link)*
  - Justice Holme's **Sweat and Blood**
    - The Constitution is a living organism maintained by "sweat and blood"
- The Treaty Power and Congress's Other Powers
  - Assumption of Congress to regulate under the treaty power even on subjects beyond its otherwise enumerated powers.
    - Rejection of [Missouri] Argument especially when concerned with the protection of individual rights that were enumerated.
    - Entering a treaty in this case does not give Congress over infringement of individual rights.
      - See *[Reid v. Covert](Link)*
  - Treaty created Statute
    - Legislative Intent behind statutory interpretation did not cover the case
      - See *[Bond v. United States](link)*
        - Dissent:
          - Overly broad statute covers case.
          - Treaty power is not a substantive power over laws of United States, it is just a process by which the US Government enters into the agreement.
        -

#### Congressional power over "foreign affairs"
- Court has recognized the power of Congress to regulate Foreign Affairs.
  - Sustaining a staturory provision regarding loss of citizenship.
- The States that joined together to form a single Nation and to create through the Constitution a Federal Government to conduct the affair of that Nation must be held to have granted that Government the powers indispensible to its functioning effectively in the company of sovereign nations.


#### Does the Consitution Follow the Flag?
- See *[Downes v. Bidwell](Link)*
  - Fruit merchant brought a challenge to US law which enacted a duty on imports from the territory of Puerto Rico on the ground that it violated Artcile 1 Section 8 of the Constitution
    - All duties imposts and excises shall be uniform through teh United States.
  - Puerto Rico Duty was Constitutionally permissible
    - "Throughout the several States" & "Among the Several States" != Puerto Rico
- War Powers & Treaty Powers are potent powers of Congress
  - Guardrails set in place, but Court gives some latitude to Congress.

### Executive Privileges, Imunities and Congress's Power of Impeachment
- To what extent do President's & Subordinates have protections?
  - Main Congressional Remedy = Impeachment
    - Cumbersome process requires majority in the House and 2/3rds majority in the Senate
- Can the president give evidence
  - See *[United States v. Nixon](link)*
    - Occurred after Watergate Scandle
    - Both Government and ∆s claim President has evidence and served subpeona
      - Nixon claimed immunity
        - Ameneability - President Cannot Be Sued
        - Presidential Autonomy - Political Question Decision is with the President
        - If wrong about above, Absolute Privilege against revealing documents that would discredit office of President
    - Court's Response - We Make The Call
      - Can you sue the President?
        - President is amenable to lawsuit
      - Courts Decide on Executive Privilege and Political Question
      - Separation of Powers and Presidential Confidentiality balance against demands of due process and judicial process.
    - Unless subject is Military, Diplomatic or National Security
- Unanswers Questions
  - Case covers scope of Courts requirement of information, what happens if Congress asks for information?
-
#### The Scope and Limits of Executive Privilege

#### Presidential and Other executive officials' amenability to judicial process

#### The Scope of Executive Privilege

#### Presidential Immunity from Civil Damages Liability for offical actions
- Absolute immunity from civil liability under some official circumstances
  - See *[Nixon v. Fitzgerald](Link)*


#### Presidential Immunity from Civil Damages liability for unofficial actions
- Court refused to expand *[Nixon v. Fitzgerald]*(link) to protect sitting President during his time in office, even temporarily from judicial process with respect to his unofficial acts.
- Deterrence factor missing in Clinton Case - Could not be deterred from vigorous presidential actions done prior to presidency.
- No immunity from suit while you are president.
  - Rejecting postponement from lawsuit until after Presidency.
  - Will not be a big distraction from presidency.
  - See *[Clinton v. Jones](link)*

      - Reads as dissent


#### Aftermath and Implications of Clinton v. Jones

#### Immunity for official v. unofficial actions

#### Dangers of Distortion v. Distraction

#### May a Sitting President Be Criminally Indicted?

#### Impeachment of the President
- Article II §4: **"...shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other Crimes and Misdemeanors..."**
  - Vague interpretation and TBD what clause entails
    - Trump impeachment?
      - What crimes could be defined as impeachable offense?
