# Separation of Powers

## Executive Assertions of Power
- See *[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer](Link)*
  - Results in Different Approaches
    1. **No Inherent Presidential Power**: Majority: Justice Black
      - There is no inherent presidential power; the president may act only if there is express constitutional/statutory authority
        - In a written government of limited powers and specifically delegated authority, the idea of "implied" or "inherent" Presidential Authority is inconsistent.
        - Congress MUST give the Executive branch power to act; the power to enforce the laws is just that; **to enforce the laws that are passed**
        - Laws must be passed not just debated
      - Has Congress Acted and Expressly Addressed the subject?
      - Black: This is a job for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its military authorities
    2. **Adverse Possession & Gloss Theory**: Justice FrankFurter
      - "It is an inadmissibly narrow conception and to disregard the **gloss**" which life has written upon them. In short a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long purused to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to uphold the Consitution, making as it were such exercise of power part of the structure of our government may be treated as a gloss on "executive" Power
    3. Legislative Accountability: Justice Jackson
      1. **Power At Apex**
        - Level of Power = Express of Implied Grant of Congressional Authority
        - Constitutionality = So long as the power does not violate another constituional provision it will be accepted.
        - Congressional Action = Has Congress Acted?
      2. **Twilight Zone**
        - Level of Power = No Grant or denial of inherent powers + Twilight of concurrent interests
        - Constitutionality = Depends on the imperatives of events and contemporary imperatives. Highly dependant on Situation Context.
        - Congressional Action = Discussion with no action, Any full congress action? Any Reluctance/Eagerness?
      3. **Lowest Ebb**
        - Level of Power = Express or Implied Denial
        - Constitutionality = Congress's law must be unconstitutional for president to violate federal law OR power is purely, expressly given to Pres by Constitutuion.
        - Congressional Action = Has Congress Acted?
    4. Broad Inherent Authority: Dissent: Chief Justice Vinson
      - The executive as  subject  only  to  the  people,  and,  under the Constitution, bound to serve the people affirmatively in cases where the Constitution does not explicitly forbid him to render the service

## Foreign Policy
- See *[Zivotofsky v. Kerry](Link)*
  - Executive Presidential Powers Analysis of **Lowest Ebb Tier**
    - Executive Alone okay if Congress not.
      1. What does the law do?
      2. Which Presidential Power does the law interfere with?
      3. Has Congress Historically interfered?
      4. What power did Congress have to pass the Law
  - Justice Scalia Dissent: *Constitution gives both President & Congress foreign policy powers; Not exclusive*
    - COngress may make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the President's powers, but hte President *must* take care that COngress's legislation "be faithfull executed"
- See *[United States v. Belmont](Link)*
- Executive Agreements
  - See *[Dames & Moore v. Regan](Link)*
    - Adopting Frankfurter's Adverse Possession Approach
      - Well established these are permitable
      - Congress expressly rejected an amendment which would have served to prevent executive agreements against treaties
- Executive Power over the States Pursuant to Treaty Power
- Executive Power, Immigration, National Security, and Religious Bias
  - See *[Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project](link)*
    - Court interprets using a Rational Basis
    - Power over immigration has long been an executive power
      - Executive examination of facts is entitled to the appropriate weight.
    - Dissent: Focus on practical applications of proclomations
      - Statements of Trump before the election
