## The US Constitution

### Creation of the US Government
- Article 1: Creation of the Legislative Power
- Article 2: Creation of the Executive Power
- Article 3: Creation of the Judicial Power

- 3 Distinct Branches of Government
  - Tensions between branches function to keep power in check
    - 17th Amendment = Direct election of Senators
    - 12th Amendment = Changing the VP to an elected official as opposed to the runner up in the presidential race
      - Also provides procedure for election of a candidate when no majority in Electoral College

### Protection of Individual Liberties
- Bill of Rights 1-10: Adopted for the express protection of individual rights against the federal government.
  - Generally only applies to government not private action/conduct

### Why a Constitution?
- Inherently difficult to change.
  - Strict adherence to process in order to amend and change USC
- Constitution represents an attempt by society to limit itself and protect the values it cherishes most.
  - Ulysses tied to the mast so as to ensure his earlier instructions are followed as opposed to his commands at the hands of the sirens.

### Implications
- **Intentionally designed as an anti-majoritarian document**
- Should be appraised as to whether or not it succeeds in restraining the majority, especially in times of crisis, while also protecting minority rights.
  - Korematsu regarded as a failure in this sense.
- Protecting long term values from short term passions

### Interpretation of the Constitution
- 3 Major Factors
  - What does the Constitution not expressly consider?
    - The Constitution is an outline, a blueprint and does not address numerous issues that arise in court..
  - Much of the Constitution is written in open-textured language
    - Interpretation of Content & Meaning of Phrases
  - What if any, government justification are sufficient to permit the Government to interfere with a fundamental right or to discriminate
- Originalism v. Neooriginalism
  - **Originalism** = Courts deciding consitutional issues should confine themselves to enforcing norms that are stated or clearly implicit in the written Constitution.
  - **NeoOriginalism** = Courts should go beyond the set of references and enforce norms that cannot be discovered with a document alone
- Who should interpret the Constitution
  - All Branches must uphold the US Constition but who has final say in a conflict?
    - Approach 1: No Authoratative Power
      - Each branch has equal say and interprets the constitution as they see fit not as how others interpret it
    - Approach 2: Each branch has authority in certain areas
      - Best describes current system
        - Example: Courts will not interpret Political Questions
    - Approach 3: Judiciary as Authoratative Power
      - Court as umpire - Marbury v. Madison
          - Marshall: It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.
