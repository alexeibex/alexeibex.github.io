# The Dormant Commerce Clause

## Facial Discrimination Against Out-of-State Commerce
- Courts treat as "virtually per se invalid" laws that facially dscriminate against interstate commerce

### Home Processing Requirements
- *Dean Milk Co. v. Madison*
- *C & A Carbone, Inc. v Clarkstown*
  - Struck down statute establishing *Private* Waste Facility
  - Government spending on private enterprise
- *United Haulers Ass'n v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority*
  - Upheld State Statute on Public Waste Facility
  - Government provided service

### The Dean Milk-Carbone-United Haulers Trilogy

#### Intrastate discrimination and interstate discrimination
  - Regulation of both local and out-of-state producers.
  - Immeterial the level of government (Town, State, City)

#### Reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives
  - Any reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives to the issues presented?
  - Uniform safety regulation would still invovle judicial scruitiny.
  - Statues not passed in bad faith, but given the subject of statute, suggest motives of protectionism
  - *Dean Milk Case*


#### Traditional Government Function
  - The activity as a "traditional function" of the state
    - Government Taking out the trash v. Government paying private company to take out the trash

#### Differential Taxation of Municipal Bonds
  - *Department of Revenue of Kentucky v. Davis*
    - Exemption of interest on states own public bonds from state income taxes but imposed such taxes on bond interest from other states.

### The Market Participant Exception
  - When states act not as a **regulator** but as a "market participant"
  - Series of decisions have establsihed the exception
  - *South Central Timber Development Inc. v. Wunnicke*
    - Citing: *Alexandria Scrap*, *Reeves, Inc.* *White v. MA*
      - <details>
          <ul>
          <li>Alexandria - Buying and removing junked cars</li>
            <ul>
              <li>No regulation of private market, instead actively in the market</li>
              <li>Permissable to favor citizens</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Reeves - Ownership of a cement plant</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Upholding favoring of in-state contracts - State as seller</li>
            </ul>
          <li>White - MA construction projects must hire 50% MA workers</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Upheld as workers for the city, can refer their own residence</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </details>
  - **Supreme Court limits Market Participant Exception to the market that it is directly invovled in, not the markets below it after it has completed its service**
    - Tree Cutting v. Tree Processing = 2 Distinct & Separate Markets
  - Three ways to get around courts decision
    - Subsidies
    - State can sell exclusively to in-state company processors
    - State can enter the market of processing


#### The Theory and Limits of the Market Participation Exception
#### Justifying state preferences for in-states through subsidies rather than regulation
- Textual
  - Commerce clause = the power to "regulate" commerce among the several states
    - Subsidies != regulation
- Economic Effect
- Parity with Private Actors
- Federalism
  - Respecting State Sovereignty
- Investment Capture
  - State capture the benefits of its citizen's tax investments
  - States able to hoard natural resources whose control they enjoy by chance?

#### Downstream Effect
- South-Central treated the requirement of in-state processing as impermissibly discriminatory regulation rather than a permissibly preferential subsidy because it restricted economic activity beyond the market in whcih the state was a participant.
  - Downstream v. Upstream?

## Facially Neutral Laws with Protectionist Purpose or Effect
- Courts treat laws invalid that are facially neutral but that are "protectionist" in purpose or effect
- *Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc*
  - Clear protectionism between more efficient VA milk industry and less efficient NY milk industry
  - Even though regulation applied to all NY citizens as well as out-of-state citizens
    - If regulation of just state citizens - can be okay
      - If slippage into out-of-state - dormant Commerce Clause.
- *H.P. Hood & Sons v. Du Mond*
  - Hoarding of Milk is protectionist
    - The state sare not separable economic units.


### Identifying Protectionism in Facially Neutral Laws
- Hoarding
- Protectionism
  - *Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'm*
    - NC Apple Grade Statute **could not stand **in light of its discriminatory effect even if enacted for the declared purpose of protecting consumers.
      - Burden & Discrimination
        - Raise Costs
        - Strips Advantages
        - Downgrades
  - *Bacchus Imports Ltd. v. Dias*
    - Statute invalid because it had both **purpose and effect** of discriminating in favor of local products.
    - Any effort to confer a benefit upon local industry not granted to out-of-state industry is presumptively invalid as discrimination under the Commerce Clause.
- *Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland*
  - Non-discriminatory
    - Maryland has no gas industry (no discrimination)
    - All gas flows from out of state
- *Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.*
  - Identifying **Simple-Protectionism** through banning plastic milk containers
  - Not discriminatory statute because it even handedly regulates by prohibiting all milk retailers from selling their products in plastic, non returnable milk containers without regard to whether the comtainers or the sellers are from outside the state.
  - Only if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State's legitimate purposes does such a regulation violate the commerce clause.
  - Even granting that the out-of-state plastics industry is burdened relatively more heavily than the Minnesota pulpwood industry we find this burden is not "**cleary excessive**"
  - A nondiscriminatory regulation serving substantial state purposes is not invalid simply because it causes some business to shift from a predominantly out-of-state industry to a predominantly in-state industry.

## Facially Neutral Laws with a Disproportionate Adverse Effect on Commerce
- Courts treat laws that is neither discriminatory nor protectionist still may be reviewed and struck down under the Court's residual balancing test.
  - Burdens outweigh benefits
  - Pike Test
    - *Pike v. Bruce Church Inc.*
      - Where the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be uphueld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is **clearly excessive** in relation to the punitive local benefits.
        - If a legitimate local pupose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.
          - Extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend onthe nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.
  - *Kassel v. Consol. Freightways Corp.*
    - Empircal Balance
    - Legislative Intent
    - Protectionist Purpose

### Balancing Interstate Harm Against Local Benefit
#### Deference to local safety concerns
- *South Carolina State Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros*
  - Upheld South Carolina Law prohbiting the use on state highways of trucks that were over 90 inches wide or that had a gross weight over 20,000 pounds.
- *Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona*
  - Court invalidated the Arizona Train Limit Law prohibiting railroad trains of more than 14 passengers or 70 freight cars.
- *Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc.*
  - Court would invalidate facially neutral laws with a disprorportionate effect on interstate commerce.
    - Local Mudgard law conflicted with a majority of states which authorized said mudgards.

#### State Burdens on Business Entry
- *Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc.*
  - Prohibiting ownership of local investment advisory business by out-of-state banks, bank holding companies and trust companies.

## The Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV
- The Citizen of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States
  - "A state may not discriminate between its own residents and residents of other States on the basis of state citizenship"

### The Scope and Limits of Interstate Privileges and Immunities
#### The Threshold requirement of an Art IV "privilege"
- Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper
  - Holding that a state rule limiting bar admission to in-state residents violated the Privileges and immunities Clause.
#### Justifying Differential Treatment of Outsiders under Art IV
- Privileges and immunities review requires only a substantial interest to which the government's reason is closely related.

## Congressional Ordering of Federal-State Relationships by Preemption and Consent

### Congressional Preemption of State Regulation
#### Modes of Preemption Analysis
- Types of Preemption
  - Express Statement
  - Implied Occupation of a regulatory field; or
  - Implied preclusion of conflicting state regulation
- **Express Preemption**
  - Whether a state statute falls within the area preempted.
- **Field Preemption**
  - Court requires a clear showing that Congress meant to occupy a field and so displace the states from regulation on that subject matter.
    - *Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp*
- **Conflict Preemption**
  - *Hines v. Davidowitz*
    - Barring enforcement of PA Alien Registration Act of 1939 because of the Federal Alien Registration Act of 1940
      - Where the federal government in the exercise of its superior authority in this field has enacted a complete scheme of regulation and has therein provided a standard for the registration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with the purpose of Congress, or interfere with, curtail, or complement, the federal law or enforce auxiliary regulations.
  - *Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul
    - Compliance with both federal and state regulation is a physical impossibility.
  - *Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Ass'n*
    - Conflict Preemption because the federal scheme forbade duplicative regulation.
#### Preemption and the Foreign Affairs Power
  - *Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council*
    - Court struck down MA law barring state entities from buying goods or services from companies doing business with Burma.
#### Federal Development Grants and Local-Hire Rules
  - *White v. Massachusetts Construction Council*
    - Court upholding an executive order by the Mayor reserving 50% of jobs on public work projects to Boston residents
#### Other devices from congressional ordering of federal-state relationships

## Other Aspects of Federal-State Relationships
### State Taxation of Intersate Business and Income
- *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady*
  - Court upheld against commerce challenge a Mississippi tax on a shipper of automobiles for the "privilege of doing business" in the state.
    - "Interstate commerce is not immune from state tax"
      - When applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State
      - When it is fairly apportioned
      - Does not discriminate against the interstate commerce
      - Fairly related to the services provided by the State
- *Quill Corp. v. North Dakota*
  - Court Clarified that the substantial nexus with a state required under the Commerce Clause is greater than the minimum contacts with a state required under the Due Process Clause.
