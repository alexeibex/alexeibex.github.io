## Substantive Due Process & Privacy
- Substantive Due Process: Providing Substance to the definition of the Due Process Clause
  - Protections of liberty are more substantive
    - "Liberty" is a lot more than just not going to jail
    - Rights of sexuality, abortion, marriage
  - Similar to Ecomomic Liberties
    - Constraining the Privilieges and Immunitites
      - See *[SlaughterHouse Cases](link)*
    - Use of the Due Process to expand Economic Liberties
      - Freedom to enter into a contract for labor
        - See *[Lochner](link)*


### Due Process & Privacy
#### Substantive Due Process & Family Rights
- Origins of Fundamental Rights under the Due Process Clause
  - Similar to Lochner Court, Government has no ability to interfere with family/children
  - Rights of Individual to Engage in any Common Occupation of life, acquire knowledge, bring up children, worship god, rights long recognized by common law as the rights of free men. Rights coming from outside the Constitution's explict provisions.
    - See *[Meyer v. Nebraska](link)*
    - See *[Pierce v. Society of Sisters](link)*

#### Substantive Due Process, Childbearing and Contraception
- Equal Protection Examination for Individual Rights
  - The Ability to have children = Basic Fundamental Civil Rights of Man
  - Source of Individual Rights is taken from "outside" the Consitution
    - See *[Skinner v. Oklahoma](link)*
      - Rejecting the Lochner Approach to Substantive Due Process to Strike Down law that infringes Reproductive Contraception Use
      - "We do not sit as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions."
- **Penumbra** Approach of Implied Rights
  - Non-Enumerated Implied Rights that Exist in the "Shadow" of The Bill Of Rights that are given light by the expressed Bill of Rights.
  - Zone of Privacy that Pre-Dates the Bill of Rights
  - Other Competing Methadologies but Still results in fundamental right of privacy.
      - Goldberg Concurrence: 9th Amendment
        - Examination the 9th Amendment & Rights Deep Rooted in our society so basic and fundamental.
      - Harlan Concurrence: Ordered Liberty
        - History and Traditions of the People in light of Traditions.
        - Lochner like formula
        - Government can regulate certain aspects of family life but requires examination of "means" to justify "ends"
      - White Concurrence: Rational Basis?
      - Justice Black/Stewart: Bill of Rights as Automatic Incorporation
        - Explicit Enumeration of Rights in Bill of Rights.
          - Rejection of giving Judges the ability to interpret the issue. Judges can give but they can also take.
            - 9th Amendment History does not give rise to a zone of privacy.
            - No General Right to Privacy in the Bill of Rights
    - See *[Griswold v. Connecticut](link)*
- Setting the Foundation for Roe
  - Removing the married requirement of Griswold

### Substantive Due Process and Abortion
- A Texas law prohibited all abortions except those necessary to preserve the life of the mother
- Source of Right:
  - Blackmun: This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s conception of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or . . . in the Ninth Amendment’s reservations of rights to the people, **is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision** whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.
- 3 Approaches by Court
  - Woman has an absolute Right to terminate pregnancy until the day of birth. (Rejected)
  - Treating a fetus as a person under the 14th Amendment (Rejected)
  - The State has an important and legitimate interest **in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman** and it has another important and legitimate interest in **protecting the potentiality of human life**
    - State's interest in preserving human life *grows with the pregnancy*
      - As time goes on, potential of life by baby increases.
      - Risks to woman's health becomes greater.
- Middle Ground Reached
  - Until End of first Trimester decision left to woman and attending physician
  - For stage subsequent to the end of the first trimester, the state may regulate the abortion in relation to maternal health
  - Subsequent to Viability, The state in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, regulate and prescribe abortion except where it is necessery for the preservation of life or health of the mother.
    - See *[Roe v. Wade](link)*

#### Implications of Roe
- Court utilizing a strict scruitiny on aspects of the Abortion process
- Permitting certain secondary restrictions on Abortions
  - State Regulation of Abortion from Roe to Casey
    - Invalidation of law requriring abortions to be performed in an accredited hospital.

    - Barring State employees from performing aboritons and the use of public facilities for abortions, even when the patient paid for the abortion herself.
      - See *[Webster v. Reporductive Health Services](link)*

#### The Undue Burden Standard of Casey (Roe Light)
- Establishing the **Undue Burden Standard** as the Appropriate Means of reconciling State interests with the Women's Constitutionally Protected Liberty.
- Loosening of the Strict Roe Standard which many considered had gone too far initially
  - See *[Planned Parenthood v. Casey](link)*
- Application of Casey
- Banning Certain Procedures
  - The Court upheld the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, holding that the state had a substantial interest in protecting fetal life.
    - Some Abortions have ethical and moral concerns which justify special prohibiton.
    - Cannot impact "large franction" of women
    - Dissent: To not be an undue burden there must be an exception for when the measure is the safest
    - See *[Gonzales v. Carhart](link)*
- Undue Burden v. Pratical Medical Benefits
  - Must measure the extent of the burden against the extent of the medical benefit
  - Breyer the Balancer - Balancing factors on both sides
    - Are these the kind of questions best suited for the Supreme Court?
  - See *[Whole Woman's Health et al. v. Hellerstedt](link)*


### Marriage & Family Relations
- Marriage Line of Cases
  - Striking down a ban on interacial marriage relying principally on Equal Protection
    - See *[Loving v. Virginia](link)
  - Vindicating a right to marry via the Equal Protection Route invaldiating Wisconsin law that provided that any resident having minor issue not in his custody and which he is under an obligation to support by any court order could not marry without obtaining court approval which depended on proof that the applicant's support obligation had been met and that children covered by the support order are not then and are not likely thereafter to become public charges.
  - Application for marriage licenses was denied because he had not obtained court permission nor could he because he had not been paying child support for daughter from previous marriage.
    - See *[Zablocki v. Redhail](link)*
  - Extending Zablocki to strike down a prison regulation that restricted prison inmates the right to marry.
    - See *[Turner v. Safley](link)*

- Household Composition Line of Cases
  - Invalidating a zonining ordinance limiting occupancy of a dwelling to members of a single "family" narrowly defined.
    - Traditions = Source of Power and the "family" deeply rooted in American History BUT;
    - Traditions = The Limits of Substantive Due Process
    - See *[Moore v. East Cleveland](link)*
  - Contrast against no privacy rights involved in a family oriented zoning restriction excluding most unrelated groups from a village without any blood ties.
    - See *[Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas](link)*

- Family Relationships and the Role of Tradition
  - Substantive Due Process requires state to give "special weight" to the parent's preferences.
    - See *[Troxel v. Granville](link)*
  - Upholding CA judgement rejecting biological father's claim for visitation over biological son weighted against Nuclear family's right to exclude him.
    - Scalia Footnote: Adulterous Illegitmate Fatherhood not recognized by our traditions and not fundamental
      - Look to History and the **Most Specific** tradition available protecting this right.
    - See *[Michael H. v. Gerald](link)*


### Sexuality & Hybrid Due Process and Equal Protection Rights

- Reproductive and Sexual autonomy and limitation on government intervention in family relationships
  - Upholding a statute as applied to "homosexual sodomy" and defining narrowly as whether or not the federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that make such conduct illegal.
  - found that there was no fundamental right to sodomy, and after looking to history, upheld state sodomy ban.
    - To claim that a right to engage in such conduct is deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty is at best facetious.
      - See *[Bowers v. Hardwick](link)*

- Source of Protection of Homosexuals under the Equal Protection Clause.
  - There is no rational basis for discriminating against homosexuals solely because of animosity towards homosexuality.
  - Applies rational basis scrutiny to overturn a constitutional amendment barring LGBT people from seeking legal protection against discrimination. Court reasons that animus **motivated** the legislation, and after being too broad and too narrow, is thus invalid.
    - See *[Romer v. Evans](link)*

- States cannot prohibit private sexual activity between consenting adults of the same sex.
  - See *[Lawrence v. Texas](link)*
    - Overruled Bowers, and invalidated a state law that only applied to same sex interactions. Found that it violated the substantive due process protections. O’Connor concurrence would have found a violation of equal protection, and not overruled Bowers.
    - Kennedy Majority:
      - Holding that state may not prohibit sexual consensual activity between consenting adults of the same sex.
      - 13 states prohibiting homosexual actvity are unconsitutional.
      - Affirmation of the right to privacy under the Constitution
      - Recognizing sexual activity as a fundamental aspect of personhood and entitled to constitutional protections.
      - Recognizing the rights of gays and lesbians to equal dignity and equal treatment under the Constitution.


- Themes of Equality within Same-Sex Decisions
  - Striking down DOMA act which had anti-gay motivations
    - See *[United States v. Windsor](link)*
      - Federalism Issues: Power between States & Fedearl Powers of Marriage
      - Equal Protection Issues: Discrimination between different sex marriage and same sex marriage
      - Similar to *[Romer](Link)* in that identifies animus and moral reasons for invalidation of statute.

- Full Protection of Same-Sex Marriage under the 14th Amendment and Equal Protection
  - See *[Obergefell v. Hodges](link)*
    - Similar to *[Loving](link)*
      - Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes & aspirations
      - Right to Choose = Individual Autonomy
      - Supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals - See *[Griswold](link)*
      - Safeguarding children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education
    - 4 Principles = Marriage as a Fundamental Right to Marry + The Right to marry anyone you want regardless of sex
      - Liberty promised by the 14th amendment and equal protection of the laws & same sex couples may not be deprived of that right and that liberty
    - Scalia Dissent:
      - This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, robs the people of the most important liberty asserted in the Declaration of Independence, **the freedom to govern themselves**.
        - Makes the people subordinate to a committee of unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.



### Constitutional Protection for Medical Care Decisions
- Court has considered 3 topics in regards to Medical Decisions
  - Circumstances where there is a constitutional right to have the government provide care
  - Whether there is a right to refuse medical care
  - Whether there is a constituitonal right to physician-assisted suicide

#### Physician-Assisted Death
- See *[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health](link)*
  - Finds that there is a liberty interest that protects the right to end life support when terminally ill, but that Due Process does not require the ill person demonstrate **with clear and convincing evidence** that it is their desire.
    - Use of Procedure to solve burden of proof standard
  - The state can properly put the burden of persuasion, in this circumstance, on the party wanting death.
    - Court Examination
      - Constitutionally protected right to refuse unwanted medical treatment
      - State may require **clear & convincing evidence** that a person wanted treatment terminated before it is cut off.
      - State may prevent family members from terminating treatment of another.

#### Differing Methodologies on Physician-Assisted Suicide
- See *[Washington v. Glucksberg](link)*
  - Rejecting facial challenge to a state law prohibiting aiding a suicide and the claim that there is a consitutional right to physician assisted suicide.
    - History and Tradition; AND
      - In almost every state & Western Democracy it is a crime to commit suicide (Deeply Rooted)
    - Implicit in the Concept of Ordered Liberty
  - Concurring Opinions: Leaving open the possibility that if the state law prohibited the provision of pain-relieving medication that also accelerated death would be unconstitutional or pain so severe that medication could not alleviate the pain.

#### Meaning and Implications of Glucksberg
- The Right to Die & Equal Protection
  - See *[Vacco v. Quill](link)*
    - Holding that laws prohibiting physician assisted suicide do not violate the equal protection clause.
      - All have the right to refuse medical care.
      - When a patient refuses life-sustaining medical treatment, he dies from an underlying fatal disease or pathology, but if a patient ingests lethal medication prescribed by a physician, he is killed by that medication.
