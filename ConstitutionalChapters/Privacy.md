## Substantive Due Process & Privacy
- Substantive Due Process: Providing Substance to the definition of the Due Process Clause
  - Protections of liberty are more substantive
    - "Liberty" is a lot more than just not going to jail
    - Rights of sexuality, abortion, marriage
  - Similar to Ecomomic Liberties
    - Constraining the Privilieges and Immunitites
      - See *[SlaughterHouse Cases](link)*

  - Similar to Lochner Court, Government has no ability to interfere with family/children
  - Rights of Individual to Engage in any Common Occupation of life, acquire knowledge, bring up children, worship god, rights long recognized by common law as the rights of free men. Rights coming from outside the Constitution's explict provisions.

      - Rejecting the Lochner Approach to Substantive Due Process to Strike Down law that infringes Reproductive Contraception Use
      - "We do not sit as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions."
- **Penumbra** Approach of Implied Rights
  - Non-Enumerated Implied Rights that Exist in the "Shadow" of The Bill Of Rights that are given light by the expressed Bill of Rights.
  - Zone of Privacy that Pre-Dates the Bill of Rights

### Substantive Due Process and Abortion
- A Texas law prohibited all abortions except those necessary to preserve the life of the mother
- Source of Right:
  - Blackmun: This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s conception of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or . . . in the Ninth Amendment’s reservations of rights to the people, **is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision** whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.
- 3 Approaches by Court
  - Woman has an absolute Right to terminate pregnancy until the day of birth. (Rejected)
  - Treating a fetus as a person under the 14th Amendment (Rejected)
  - The State has an important and legitimate interest **in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman** and it has another important and legitimate interest in **protecting the potentiality of human life**
    - State's interest in preserving human life *grows with the pregnancy*
      - As time goes on, potential of life by baby increases.
      - Risks to woman's health becomes greater.
- Middle Ground Reached
  - Until End of first Trimester decision left to woman and attending physician
  - For stage subsequent to the end of the first trimester, the state may regulate the abortion in relation to maternal health
  - Subsequent to Viability, The state in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, regulate and prescribe abortion except where it is necessery for the preservation of life or health of the mother.
