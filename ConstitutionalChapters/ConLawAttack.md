### Judicial Oversight of Act by Congress & Executive Branch


## 1. Legislative Powers to Act
- Pervasive Concerns & Themes Throughout Analysis
  - Should Congress get *involved*?
    1. Decreasing overall likelihood of Federal Tyranny
    2. Enhancing Democratic Rule - States close to the People
    3. Allowing States to be **Labratories**
  - Is it proper for the Court to intervene in the Political Process

### Legislative Subject Matter Authority under the United States Constitution

#### Legislative Sources of Power
- Federal Power under the United States Constitution
  - [Commerce Clause](alexeibex.github.io/ConstitutionalChapters/LegislativeAuthority) via the Necessary and Proper Clause)
  - [Taxing & Spending Power](https://alexeibex.github.io/ConstitutionalChapters/TaxingPower)
  - 14th Amendment Provisions
- State Power under the United States Constituion
  - Police Power of the State

#### Presidential Sources of Power
- If no recent act by legislature or to defy a legislative act President may act through
  - War Power Act
  - Declaration
  - Removal Power
  - Foreign Policy
-  *Major Theme of Push & Pull Between State v. Federal Government*
  - Case *[McCulloch](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-mcculloch-v-maryland)*

## 2. Commerce Clause Attack
### Necessary and Proper
- Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit  of the constitution, are constitutional.
- Necessary means useful & desirable not indispensible or essential
  - Case *[McCulloch](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-mcculloch-v-maryland)*
- Modern Reaffirmation under Comstock
  - Case *[Comstock](https://github.com/alexeibex/alexeibex.github.io/blob/master/constitutionallaw.md#case-us-v-comstock)*
- Limits on Necessary & Proper
  - Necessary and Proper must be used in conjunction with an existing power of Congress.
  - Case *[NFIB v. Sebelius](https://github.com/alexeibex/alexeibex.github.io/blob/master/constitutionallaw.md#national-federation-of-independent-business-v-sebelius---individual-mandate)*

#### Test of Necessary & Proper
- Necessary is a grant not a limit of Congress
  1. Is the end within **enumerated scope** of Constitution?
  2. Is there some minimal degree of **fit between the means and the ends** - is the law appropriate (Rational Basis)
  3. Does anything in the Constituion prevent what is trying to be done?
- Because most things do not cross interstate lines, necessary and proper must be invoked to give Congress Authority.

##### Is it Proper?
- ***Comstock Factors*** - Reasonably Adapted
  1. Is the end within enumerated powers
    - Breadth of necessary and proper clause does not need a **specific** enumerated power - Logical Jumps allowed
    - History of Federal Involvement in Area
  2. Minimal Degree of Fit
    - Sound reasons for statute enacement in light of Custodial interest
  3. Does Constituion Prevent the Act?
    - Accomodation of State interest
    - Narrow Scope

##### Is it Necessary?
- ***Sebelius***
  - Necessary if there are no other alternatives within an enumerated power.


### **Commerce Power** via Necessary & Proper
- Under the Commerce Power via the Necessary and Proper clause of the USC, Congress may regulate any **thing** which has a **substantial effect** on interstate commerce. Congress may also regualte any channels and instrumentalities of commerce as well.
  - Case: *[Gibbons v. Ogden](https://github.com/alexeibex/alexeibex.github.io/blob/master/constitutionallaw.md#case-gibbons-v-ogden)*
- Recent Concurrence in Case: *Lopez*
  - Distinction between "manufacturing & commerce"
    - Commerce is distinct stage of market process

#### Types of Activity Covered as Commerce
- Case: *Perez*
  1. Channels of Interstate Commerce
    - Navigable Waters & Highways - Case: *Gibbons*
  2. Instrumentalities of Interstate Commerce
    - Lottery tickets,Commercial Items Crossing State Lines
  3. Activities with a Substantial Effect on Interstate Commerce
    - Intrastate Commerce Included
      - Requires Aggregation of Activity - Case: *Wickard*
      - Post *Lopez* Threshold of inquiry for *substantial effect*
        - If underlying activity traditionally left to the states, even if commercial then there is **NO aggregation**

##### Instrumentalities of Commerce
- Instrumentality:
  - Object or conduct as instrumental to interstate commerce
    - Hotels instrumental to interstate travel
      - Case: [*Heart of Atlanta*](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-heart-of-atlanta-motel-v-united-states)
- Rational Basis Scruitiny on Instrumentality


##### Substantial Effects to Commerce
- Impediments or Utilization of Interstate Commerce
  - Discrimination of Hotel Business affects interstate travel
    - Case: [*Heart of Atlanta*](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-heart-of-atlanta-motel-v-united-states)
  - Use of ingredients from interstate affects commerce
    - Case: [McClung](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-katzenbach-v-mcclung)
  - Nationwide regulation of illegal drugs
    - Case: [Raich](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-gonzales-v-raich)
- Not Substantial Effects on Commerce
  - Regulation of Inactivity
    - Case: [Sebelius](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-national-federation-of-independent-business-v-sebelius)
  - Non-Economic, Criminal or Tradtionally State Activity
    - Case: [Lopez](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-united-states-v-lopez)
  - Traditional State Regulation of Morality - Nationwide law against gender violence
    - Case: [Morrison](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-united-states-v-morrison)
- Rational Basis Test Applied to Substantial Effects


#### 10th Amendment Zone & Dual Sovereignty
- Since *Lopez* 10th Amendment has been revived to prevent federal intrusion into areas tradtionally within the purview of the state.
- Anti-Comandeering Concerns
  - Focus on the **Means** of implementation
  - Federal Government may not compel states to enact a law or administer a regulatory program under the Commerce Clause
  - Federal Government may not require states to perform executive functions
    - Case: [New York v. United States](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-new-york-v-united-states)
  - Fedreal Government may not compel state executive officials to enforce federal law. Does not matter if the object travels interstate
  - Case: [Printz](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-printz-v-united-states)
- Fedreal Government Restricting Actions is Okay
  - Restrictions on state level executives and regulation which might impact but not compel state practices by prohibiting conduct are valid
    - Case: [Reno v. Condon](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-reno-v-condon)

#### Anti Comandeering via Taxing and Spending
- Congress may use the spending power to incentivize programs if it is powerless to enforce:
  - Conditions
    - Receipt of Federal Funds bears some relationship to purpose of federal spending
      - Case: [Dole](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-south-dakota-v-dole)
    - Cannot use crippiling amount of funds to **coerce** state leaders into accepting conditions
      - Dole = 5% of state budget v. Sebelius 10% of state income (Gun to head)
      - Case: [Sebelius](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-national-federation-of-independent-business-v-sebelius-2)

## 3. Fundamental Rights
- Presence of a Fundamental Right will invoke a **strict scrutiny analysis** through both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause

  - Define the practice at the most **specific level**
    - Scalia Footnote 6: Look to history and the most specific traditions available to protect the right

#### Obergefell Method

## 4. Dormant Commerce Clause & Privileges and Immunities
- If a law's **purpose OR effect** is to substantially burden interstate commerce, it will be shown as invalid.
- Two Tests to Determine if Valid
  1. Dormant Commerce
  2. Privileges & Immunities

### Dormant Commerce Clause
#### Discrimnatory Purpose or Effect
#### Facially Discriminatory (Strict Scruitiny)
- Purpose clearly met
  - Case: [Baldwin](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-baldwin-v-g-a-f-seelig-inc)


#### Discrinatory Purpose or Effect (Strict Scruitiny)
- Effects based on Case [Hunt v. Washington State Apples](link)
  - Raising cost of doing business
  - Removing Competitive advantage of another state's costly enterprise
  - leveling effect on local business against better out of state business
  - Light impact on will receive rational basis review
    - Rational Basis Review: Evidence + Legitimate Interest
      - Case: [Kassel](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-kassel-v-consol-freightways-corp)

#### Application of Proper Test
- Rational Basis v. Strict Scruitiny
  - Rational Basis Req:
    - Legitimate Interest
    - Actual Evidence
      - Case: [Kassel](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-kassel-v-consol-freightways-corp)
  - Strict Scruitiny
    - Strong Presumption against **Facially Discriminatory Laws** with a **Clear Effect**
      - Compelling Purpose
      - Narrowly Tailored
      - Alternatives Available

#### Exceptions to Dormant Commerce Clause
- Congressional Approval of State Law
  - If Congress Approves a state law it will be endorsed by the Commerce Clause
  - Market Participant Exception
    - Allowing states to favor their own citizens in receiving benefits from government programs and in dealing with government owned business

### Privileges and Immunities
- States are not allowed to dscriminate against out-of-state citizens with regard to the protection and allocation of **fundamental rights**
  - *The Citizens of each State shall be entitiled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the Several States*

#### Articulation of Fundamental Rights & Out of Staters
- Analysis of rights related to the given prohibition by traditional or Obergefell analysis
- State law facially treats out-of-state citizens differently
  - Does not apply to aliens, corps or non citizens

#### Application of Scrutiny
- Intermediate Scrutiny
  - Substantial Government Reason for Different Treatment; AND
  - Discrimination against nonresidents bears a substantial relationship to the objective
  - Analyzing the fit the court must consider less restrictive means but not the least restrictive
    - Case: [Piper](https://alexeibex.github.io/constitutionallaw#case-supreme-court-of-new-hampshire-v-piper)
