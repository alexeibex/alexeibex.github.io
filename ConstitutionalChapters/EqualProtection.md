### Standards of Review
- 3 Tiers
  - Strict
    - Race
  - Intermediate
    - Sex/Gender
  - Rational Basis

#### Rational Basis Review
- **"Why Me?"**
  1. Legitimate State Purpose
  2. Substantial Deference to Legislature
  3. Reasonably Related
- Note: Animus Concern


#### Deference to a Rational Basis
- The government has a legitimate purpose if it advances a traditional “police” purpose: protecting safety, public health, or public  morals.
- Under & Overinclusive laws allow legislature to take "small steps" toward figuring out a problem. Court is willing to tolerate some overinclusiveness and some underinclusiveness
when utilizing rational basis.
  - Safety
    - See *[Railway Express Agency v. New York](link)*
      - Upholding law banning certain advertising vehicles because city "might perceive" them to be a danger in traffic
        - "It is no requirement of equal protection that all evils of the same genus be eradicated or none at all"
    - See *[NY Transit Authority v. Beazer](link)*
      - Restricting unsafe drivers for administrative efficiency of excluding all methadone users instead of running drug screening.
  - Health
    - See *[Williamson v. Lee Optical](link)*
      - Upholding law preventing certain opticians from making new glasses. Legislature may have concluded this "potentially advanced" public health
    - See *[New Orleans v. Dukes](link)*
      - Keeping street vendors from dirtying streets
  - Morality

#### Exception for classification based on "animus"
- Express purpose of discriminating against hippies, homosexuals, or other undesirables is not legitimate purpose
  - See *[U.S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno]*
    - Purpose of increasing agricultural economy was legitimate but failed because wholly unrelated to rule.
- See *[NY Transit Authority v. Beazer](link)*
  - Restricting unsafe drivers


#### Deferrence for Economic Matters so long as Conceivable Legitimate Purpose
- See *[U.S. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz](link)*
  - The Supreme Court upheld a federal law designed to prevent retired railroad workers from receiving benefits under both the  Social Security system and the railroad retirement system.
  - Where as here, there are plausible reasons for Congress's action, our inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, constitutionally   irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlies the legislative decision because this Court never has insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute. This is particularly true where the legislature must necessarily  engage in a process of line drawing.

#### Rationality Review with Bite
- No tolerance for under or overinclusivity - Regardless of your purpose, Court will apply stricter scrutiny anyway
  - When Reasons are not believed, Court will invoke Rational Basis with a Bite
    - See *[Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal v. Webster County](link)*
    - See *[USDA v. Moreno](link)*


### Race Discrimination
- Historic Background was to specifically protect African-Americans
  - Elimination of Race as a Discriminatory Category
    - See *[Strauder v. West Viginia](link)*

#### Separate but Equal
- Court sustained an 1890 Louisiana law that required "equal but separate accommodations" for white and colored railroad passengers
  - See: *[Plessy v. Ferguson](link)*
    - First: the Thirteenth Amendment only applied to labor systems.
    - Second: the Fourteenth Amendment abolished legal but not social distinctions between races. “Separate but equal” does not impose a “badge of inferiority.”

#### Brown
- The NAACP advanced two arguments against “separate but equal.” First, most states did not attempt to show that separate facilities were actually equal, so the NAACP hoped the “separate but equal” defense would be unavailing. Second, genuinely separate but equal facilities would be awesomely expensive and ultimately impossible.
- The Court heard Brown and four companion cases during the 1952 term. In 1953, it set the cases for reargument, possibly because the Court was badly split on the outcome. Before reargument, Chief Justice Vinson died and Chief Justice Warren took his place.
  - See: *[Brown v. Board of Education (Brown 1)](Link)*
