# Equal Protection
### Standards of Review
- 3 Tiers
  - Strict
    - Race
  - Intermediate
    - Sex/Gender
  - Rational Basis

#### Rational Basis Review
- **"Why Me?"**
  1. Legitimate State Purpose
  2. Substantial Deference to Legislature
  3. Reasonably Related
- Note: Animus Concern


#### Deference to a Rational Basis
- The government has a legitimate purpose if it advances a traditional “police” purpose: protecting safety, public health, or public  morals.
- Under & Overinclusive laws allow legislature to take "small steps" toward figuring out a problem. Court is willing to tolerate some overinclusiveness and some underinclusiveness
when utilizing rational basis.
  - Safety
    - See *[Railway Express Agency v. New York](link)*
      - Upholding law banning certain advertising vehicles because city "might perceive" them to be a danger in traffic
        - "It is no requirement of equal protection that all evils of the same genus be eradicated or none at all"
    - See *[NY Transit Authority v. Beazer](link)*
      - Restricting unsafe drivers for administrative efficiency of excluding all methadone users instead of running drug screening.
  - Health
    - See *[Williamson v. Lee Optical](link)*
      - Upholding law preventing certain opticians from making new glasses. Legislature may have concluded this "potentially advanced" public health
    - See *[New Orleans v. Dukes](link)*
      - Keeping street vendors from dirtying streets
  - Morality

#### Exception for classification based on "animus"
- Express purpose of discriminating against hippies, homosexuals, or other undesirables is not legitimate purpose
  - See *[U.S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno](link)*
    - Purpose of increasing agricultural economy was legitimate but failed because wholly unrelated to rule.
- See *[NY Transit Authority v. Beazer](link)*
  - Restricting unsafe drivers


#### Deferrence for Economic Matters so long as Conceivable Legitimate Purpose
- See *[U.S. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz](link)*
  - The Supreme Court upheld a federal law designed to prevent retired railroad workers from receiving benefits under both the  Social Security system and the railroad retirement system.
  - Where as here, there are plausible reasons for Congress's action, our inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, constitutionally   irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlies the legislative decision because this Court never has insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute. This is particularly true where the legislature must necessarily  engage in a process of line drawing.

#### Rationality Review with Bite
- No tolerance for under or overinclusivity - Regardless of your purpose, Court will apply stricter scrutiny anyway
  - When Reasons are not believed, Court will invoke Rational Basis with a Bite
    - See *[Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal v. Webster County](link)*
    - See *[USDA v. Moreno](link)*


### Race Discrimination
- Historic Background was to specifically protect African-Americans
  - Elimination of Race as a Discriminatory Category
    - See *[Strauder v. West Viginia](link)*

#### Separate but Equal
- Court sustained an 1890 Louisiana law that required "equal but separate accommodations" for white and colored railroad passengers
  - See: *[Plessy v. Ferguson](link)*
    - First: the Thirteenth Amendment only applied to labor systems.
    - Second: the Fourteenth Amendment abolished legal but not social distinctions between races. “Separate but equal” does not impose a “badge of inferiority.”

#### Setup to Brown
- The NAACP advanced two arguments against “separate but equal.”
  - Most states did not attempt to show that separate facilities were actually equal, so the NAACP hoped the “separate but equal” defense would be unavailing.
  - Genuinely separate but equal facilities would be awesomely expensive and ultimately impossible.
    - Tangible v. Intagible qualities of facilities and equality
      - See *[Sweatt v. Painter](link)*
    - Restrictions on learning and to engage in study is not equal
      - See *[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents](link)*

#### Brown v. Board of Ed
- The Court heard Brown and four companion cases during the 1952 term. In 1953, it set the cases for reargument, possibly because the Court was badly split on the outcome. Before reargument, Chief Justice Vinson died and Chief Justice Warren took his place.
  - A “Dissent” from Brown: The Southern Manifesto
      - The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend it to affect education. Indeed, the Amendment’s authors were the same men who voted to segregate Washington, D.C.’s schools.
      - The members of the Court “undertook to exercise their naked political power and substituted their personal political and social ideas for the established law of the land.”
  - Parties’ arguments about the history and intent of the Fourteenth Amendment do not sufficiently resolve the issue.
  - “To separate them (i.e., black students) from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.”
  - Held: “in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”
  - **Record Testimony extensively used in determining Opinion**
    - See: *[Brown v. Board of Education (Brown 1)](Link)*


#### Meaning & Implications of Brown
- Separate but Equal & The Due Process Clause
  - On the same day as Brown, the Court held that segregation in DC’s public schools violated due process because it arbitrarily deprives black students of liberty (presumably, to pursue education)
  - Utilization of Reverse Incorporation
    - See *[Bolling v. Sharpe](link)*

#### Theory of Brown

#### Racial Discrimination Against Racial Minorities
- Declared clearly unconstitutional
  - But court left the door open.
    - Government cannot use race in a subordinate way but in some circumstances race can be used
      - See *[Korematsu v. United States](link)*
    - Travel Ban
      - See *[Trump v. Hawaii](link)*



#### Racially Discriminatory Purpose & Effect
- Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and and unequal hand so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances the denail of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.
  - See *[Yick Wo v. Hopkins](link)*


#### Facially Neutral Laws with Racially Discriminatory Effect
- That  there  must  be proof of a discriminatory purpose in order for such laws to be treated as racial or national origin classifications.
  - See *[Washington v. Davis](link)*

#### Meaning & Implication of Washington v. Davis
- Demonstrating Discriminatory Effect
  - Impact so clearly discriminatory as to allow no other explaination than that it was adopted for impermissible purposes
  - Historical Context
  - Legislative or Administrative History
    - See *[Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.]*
- Shifting Burden to Government
  - Demonstration that Government would have taken the same action regardless of race or national origin.

#### Legislative History & Evidence of Discrimination for a Facially Neutral Law
  - See *[Rogers v. Lodge](link)*
  - See *[Hunter v. Underwood](link)*

### Affirmative Action
- UC Davis’s affirmative action plan was unconstitutional. However, race is not categorically off limits.
  - See *[Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke](link)*
  - Diversity is a compelling interest in education and universities may use race as a factor to ensure diversity, but quotas or   numerical quantification of benefits is impermissible.
- Five Justices—Justice Powell on equal protection grounds and four Justices on statutory grounds—found impermissible the University of California at  Davis  Medical  School's  set-aside  of  16  slots in the entering class of 100 for minority students.
  - Justice  Powell said that the University of California at Davis Medical School could use race as one criterion in  admissions decisions.
    - Requires a Strict Scruitiny Analysis
      - “Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination"
        - Requires **Compelling Interest**
    - The Davis program had four goals:
      1. Reduce the historic deficit of minorities in medical school and the medical profession.
      2. Counter the effects of societal discrimination.
      3. Increase the number of physicians who will work in underserved communities.
      4. Obtain the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.
  - The Court held that all but the last were unconstitutional. It held that a system like Harvard’s, which awards a “plus” to minority applicants, would be permissible—but a quota system like Davis’s is not allowed.
- Dissenting Judges
  - Intermediate Scruitiny for Remedial Purposes
    - **Substantially Related** Requriement for the achievement of those objectives
      - Problems arising from Stigmitization
      - Powerless to escape immutible characteristics
  - Justice Blackmun, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
    - Race-neutral affirmative action is impossible. “In order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.
    - Justice Marshall, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
      - Marshall began with a long history of racial inequality in the US. That history created a range of present inequalities.
      - The Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit remedies for past discrimination.


#### Strict Scrutiny for Racial Classifications By Congress
- All racial classifications imposed by the federal, state, or local government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny; that is, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests.
  - See *[Adarand Contractors v. Pena](link)*
    - The Croson rule: That any racial classification is subject to strict scrutiny
      - Applies to Congressional actions as well as state and local actions.


#### Affirming Bakke & Strict Scrutiny
- All racial classifications imposed by the government must be analyzed by reviewing court under strict scruitiny.
  - See *[Grutter v. Bollinger](link)*
    - Citing Bakke: When governmental decisions involve race or ethnicity, the government must show a “compelling governmental interest.
      - **Student body diversity is such an interest**
- Automatic Point Bonus for Minority
  - Universities using point systems for admissions cannot grant automatic bonuses to minority applicants because of their race.
    - See *[Gratz v. Bollinger](link)*
- Any official action that treats a person differently on account of his or her race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect.
- Government bears the burden to prove that the reason for any racial classification are clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.
- Public college may consider race as a factor in admissions only if the admissions program is narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.
  - See *[Fisher v. University of Texas](link)*

#### Racial Diveristy In K-12 Public Education
- Schools cannot consider race when assigning students to schools, even if racial imbalances exist between schools.
  - Kennedy Concurrence:
    - Existence of facially race neutral alternatives to achieve this objective. Soft Factors.
    - See *[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District](link)*

#### Arguments for & Against Strict Scruitiny


### Racial Discrimination and Voting Disctricts
- Race preferences in electoral districting can be considered, but cannot be the primary motivation.
- Racial Gerrymandering will receive strict scrutiny
  - See *[United Jewish Organizations v. Carey](link)*
- Race cannot be the motivation of a redistricting plan.
  - The use of race in drawing election districts is permissible only if the government can show that it is   necessary to achieve a compelling purpose.
  - Court deferentially upheld redistricting aimed at maintaining black control of congressional district)
    - See *[Shaw v. Reno](link)*
  - If it is not obvious from the shape of the district that race was used in drawing its lines, the judiciary should usestrict scrutiny if it is demonstrated that race was a  “predominant” factor in districting.
    - See *[Miller v. Johnson](link)*
  - Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because   redistricting is performed with consciousness of race. Nor does it apply to all cases ofintentional creation of  majority-minority  districts.
  - For strict scrutiny to apply, the plaintiffs must prove that other legitimate districting principles were ‘subordinated’ to race.
    - *[Bush v. Vera](link)*


### Sex Discrimination & Gender
#### Early Cases on Gender
- The Court rejected early attempts to apply the Fourteenth Amendment to sex discrimination, e.g.,
  - Justice Bradley’s dissent in Bradwell, based on the “separate spheres”
  - It held similarly that the right to vote ideolog was not a privilege or immunity.
- Court upheld a Michigan “barmaid” law on rational basis review.
  - See *[Goesaert v. Cleary](link)*
- While purportedly applying rational review, the Court struck down an Idaho law that preferred men over women as estate administrators as “the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
  - See *[Reed v. Reed](link)*

#### Heightened Scrutiny for Gender Classification
- Gender based classifications require heightened scrutiny
  - Strict Scruitny does not get a hold
    - See *[Frontiero v. Richardson](link)*
      - Like race, sex is immutable and “frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.

#### Intermediate  Scrutiny  as  the  Appropriate  Level  of Review for Gender Classification
  - Gender rights advocates argued that the Court should apply strict scrutiny to gender classification.
  - This view won a plurality but not a majority in Frontiero. The court ultimately settled on intermediate scrutiny
    - See *[Craig v. Boren](link)*
      - The Court adopted intermediate scrutiny. “To regulate in a sex discriminatory fashion, the government must demonstrate that its use of sex-based criteria is “**substantially related**” to the achievement of “important government objectives”.”
        - It never explained why it employed different standards for race and gender.

#### Sex Equality After Craig v. Boren
- Toward Stricter Scrutiny
  - The  Court applied intermediate scrutiny to declare unconstitutional a state policy of operating a nursing school that was available only to women.
    - Nursing as a sterotype cannot be used as a justification for substantially related to protecting women
      - See *[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan](link)*
  - Distinctions based on physical sex differences are held to a similar standard, but are more likely to convince the court
    - See *[United States v. Virginia](link)*

#### Sex Based Premptory Strikes
- More than important, justification must be exceedingly persuasive.
  - See *[J.E.B v. Alabama ex rel. T.B](link)*

#### Intermediate Scrutiny with a BITE
- Exceedingly persuasive justification
  - Must be actual reasons and court needs to search for gender neutral alternatives
  - **Always requires ACTUAL reason - Court cannot Guess**
    - See *[United States v. Virginia](link)*
      - All governmental gender classifications must be substantially related to an important government purpose that can be demonstrated by the government if it offers an exceedingly persuasive justification for the classification
      - Single- gender education is permissible as long there are separate but equal facil- ities for both males and females. Any gender-based state action requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.”

#### Permissible Sex-Based Differences
- Legislation that differentiates between sexes based on biological factors is not necessarily discriminatory. Applying the Feeney principle, the Court held that pregnancy was not a pretext for the legislature to invidiously discriminate against women.
- Distinctions based on physical sex differences are held to a similar standard, but are more likely to convince the court
  - Pregnancy can be treated differently.
  - *See *[Geduldig v. Aiello](link)*
    - Upholds excluding pregnancy related disabilities from the state disability insurance system.
- Statutory Rape Laws can consider sex
  - See *[Michael M. v. Superior Court](link)*
  - Upholds a statutory rape law that treats males and females differently. Reasoning based on history – men punished with imprisonment, women with pregnancy. Dissent argues that the law is based on stereotypes, and that a gender neutral one would be just as effective
- Selective Service does not have to include women.
    - See *[Rostker v. Goldberg](link)*
      - Rejected a challenge to the selective service only registering men, finding that Congress considered and rejected doing so. Dissent argued that there was no relation to an important governmental interest.
      - A congressional act that requires men and not women to register for a military draft does not violate the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution because women cannot statutorily participate in combat and thus are not similarly situated as men.
- Illegitimate Fathers can be treated differently.
  - See *[Parham v. Hughes](Link)*
    - Upheld a law denying illegitimate fathers the right to sue for wrongful death, finding that they can choose to become legitimate.
  - See *[Nguyen v. I.N.S](link)
    - Upheld law treating children differently depending on whether the mother or father was the citizen.
    - Found it was substantially related to the achievement of governmental interests in ensuring biological relationship, and child-parent relationship (Relaxed Intermediate Scrutiny)
  - See *[Caban v. Mohammed](link)*
    - Invalidated a law giving mothers more right in adoption proceedings than fathers of illegitimate children.
    - No substantial relation to a legitimate interest

#### Not Sex-Based Differences
- Discriminatory Effect of Sex Discrimination.
  - If a statute has a disparate impact on one gender, it is invalid only if the legislature passed it because of a desire to discriminate, not merely in spite of knowledge that a disparate impact would result.
  - If a statute has a disparate impact on one gender, it is invalid only if the legislature passed it **because of** a desire to discriminate, not merely **in spite of** knowledge that a disparate impact would result.
  - Enumerated two part test for laws challenged for their disproportionate impact: is the classification neutral with respect to gender, and if so, whether its effect reflects invidious gender based discrimination
    - See *[Personnel Administrator of Mass. V. Feeney](link)*
      - Here the court found the lifetime preference in civil service jobs for veterans to satisfy the test, as it was gender neutral, and all non veterans, men and women alike, felt the effects.
- The Intent Standard, Version 2
  - In Feeney, the Court elaborated the Davis discriminatory purpose requirement, holding that foreseeable impact “was not sufficient to prove discriminatory purpose under the Equal Protection Clause”
    - “‘Discriminatory purpose’ . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decision maker, in this case a state legislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”
      - See *[Washington v. Davis](link)*

#### Affirmative Action & Gender Based Discrimination
- Most preferential treatment for women fails, unless it is benign or compensatory
- Property Tax Exemptions
  - *[Kahn v. Shevin](link)*
    - Upheld under rational basis, pre-Craig, a property tax exemption for widows, but not widowers
- Alimony
  - Reduction of the disparity in economic condition between men and women caused by long history of dsicrimination is an important government objective
  - See *[Orr v. Orr](link)*
    - Struck down law imposing alimony on husbands but not wives – individualized considerations were required, narrow case by case can be done
- Benefits Programs
  - Law cannot be based on notion that male wages are essential to families, but female wages are merely supplemental
    - See *[Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld](link)*
  - Women getting higher social security benefits permissible to remedy longstanding disparate treatment
    - See *[Califano v. Goldfarb](link)*
  - Struck down restrictions on widower receiving survivor benefits when there were none for widows
    - See *[Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co](link)*
  - Upholding extra benefit for women & rejected male challenge to sex distinctions in promotion system.
  - Women discharged after 13 years without promotion, whereas men were discharged after two pass overs for promotion
    - See *[Schlesinger v. Ballard](link)*

### Other Suspect Classes & Fundamental Rights
- Other classifications that may warrant some form of heightened scrutiny
- Justifications for applying heightened scrutiny to other classifications
  - The Race/Gender Analogy
    - Immutability
    - Salience
    - Irrational prejudice
      - Invidious Discrimination
      - Sterotypes
    - Irrelevance
    - Powerlessness
  - The Religion Analogy
    - Irrational Prejudice
    - Irrelevance

#### Sexual Orientation
- Same Sex Marriage
  - Sexual Orientation is subject to rational basis, but it looks heightened in practice.
    - Applies rational basis scrutiny to overturn a constitutional amendment barring LGBT people from seeking legal protection against discrimination. Court reasons that animus motivated the legislation, and after being too broad and too narrow, is thus invalid)
    - See *[Romer v. Evans](link)*


#### Citizenship & Alienage & Scrutiny
- Strict Scrutiny is generally required for restrictions on legal aliens by states
  - Public interest doctrine: The state can discriminate based on alienage (1) to limit the use of public resources to its citizens, or (2) pursuant to its police powers to protect its citizens.
  - Rejection of the Public Interest Doctrine
    - Alienage is a suspect classification, calling for heightened scrutiny.
    - See *[Graham v. Richardson](link)*
      - Held that states could not deny welfare benefits to aliens, finding that status was inherently suspect, and subject to close scrutiny
  - Bar Admission
    - See *[In Re Griffiths](link)*
  - Civil Servant Jobs
    - See *[Sugarman v. Dougall](link)*
      - Invalidated law barring aliens from permanent positions in civil service, though granting an exception for certain positions related to government function
      - Sugarman government function exception has been read broadly to exclude aliens from categories of employment.
  - Police Officers
    - See *[Foley v. Connelie](link)*
      - Uses Rational Basis to uphold exclusion from police
  - Public School Teachers
    - See *[Ambach v. Norwick](link)*
      - Upheld exclusion from public school teaching
        - BUT See *[Bernal v. Fainter](link)*
          - Rejecting ban on aliens from serving as notaries
          - Alienage classifications warrant strict scrutiny. For the law to stand, it “must advance a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means available.
          - The Cabell test allows alienage classifications if the classification is (1) specific and (2) closely related to governance. Teachers, police, and probation officers meet this requirement. Notaries public do not.
          - Dissent: The Constitution itself recognizes a distinction between citizens and aliens, so how could alienage be a suspect classification
            - It’s not irrational for states to require public servants to be citizens, because public servants wield much policymaking authority. Gov- ernment will also be more efficient if citizens run it, because they understand its form and purpose

- Less scrutiny required for restrictions on legal aliens by the federal government
- Regulation of Resident Aliens
  - Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment restrict the federal government’s immigration policy?
    - Yes. There is no basis for states to distinguish between aliens and citizens of another state, but the federal government distinguishes between citizens and aliens all the time. Congress can limit aliens’ access to Medicare, even though the states can’t impose similar limitations on access to public benefits.
      - See *[Mathews v. Diaz](link)*
    - The Court invalidated a regulation that barred aliens from working in the civil service—but it based its holding on due process (finding that ineligibility for employment in a major sector of the economy was a deprivation of liberty), explicitly avoiding the question of whether the regulation violated equal protection.
      - See *[Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong](link)*

#### Disability, Age, Poverty
- Mental retardation is subject to rational basis scrutiny
  - Reduced mental capacity justifies special treatment from state
  - Not discriminatory
  - Group is not politically powerless
  - The effects of permitting heightened scrutiny are too numerous.
- Heightened scrutiny is being applied, as the permit denial has a rational basis – in turn advocates for varying the level of scrutiny with the importance of the interest affected, and the invidiousness of the discrimination (History of Discrimination)
    - See *[Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.](Link)*
      - Denial of a permit for the operation of homes for the mentally retarded violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution where such denial is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.
- Age classifications are subject to rational basis
  - See *[Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia](link)*
    - Holds that rational basis scrutiny is required in upholding mandatory retirement age for state police
    - Since physical ability generally declines with age, mandatory retirement at age 50 serves to remove from  police service   those whose fitness for uniformed work presumptively has diminished with age.
    - This clearly is rationally relatedt o the State's objective
- Poverty and Wealth Classifications
- Wealth classifications are subject to rational basis
  - See *[James v. Valtierra](link)*
    - Upheld a law requiring voter approval for the creation of low income housing. Found that rational basis was the proper level of scrutiny

#### The "Fundamental Interest" Branch of Equal Protection
- Fundamental Rights unenumerated in the Constitution also merit strict scrutiny.


##### Fundamental Interest in Voting
- No Explicit Right to Vote but...
- Access to voting is deemed a fundamental right protected by the equal protection clause
- Poll Taxes
  - See *[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Educations](link)*
    - Court finds that the right to vote is a fundamental right, and that while states do not have to hold elections, if they do, then equal protection requires that the right be extended to all. Here the court strikes down a poll tax, finding that it places a wealth restriction on the right to vote, and that this is not a legitimate state purpose.
    - Once the franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be drawn which are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause
- Property Ownership Requirements
  - See *[Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15](Link)*
    - Struck down restrictions on right to vote in school district elections to parents of children, and land owners/renters.
    - Court found that there must be a compelling interest to restrict the right to vote
    - Limited purpose elections can restrict the right to vote when only a discrete class is the sole interested party
      - See *[Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District](link)*
        - Upholds restriction for voting in water district to landowners in the district.
        - Applies minimal scrutiny
- Disenfranchisement of Felons
- Felons can be disenfranchised, even after serving sentence.
  - See *[Richardson v. Ramirez](link)*
    - Court upheld state disenfranchisement of former felons, finding that §2 of the 14th Amendment, denying vote to those that participate in “rebellion, or other crime” justified.
- Voter ID Laws
  - See *[Crawford v. Marion County Election Board](link)*
- Counting & Recounting Votes
  - See *[Bush v. Gore](link)*

##### Vote Dilution
- Historically, the court was reluctant to enter into districting matters, finding that they were political matters.
  - See *[Colegrove v. Green](link)*
    - Court refused to hear challenge to districting law, finding that it was a political matter beyond the reach of the judiciary
- Malaportionment however can be considered justicable under Equal Protection
  - See *[Baker v. Carr](link)*
    - Court rejected claim that equal protection challenges to apportionment schemes were nonjusticiable
- One person, one vote is the required standard in districting
  - See *[Reynolds v. Sims](link)*
    - Court finds state’s lack of redistricting for sixty years unconstitutional, as it violates equal protection.
    - Finds that one person one vote is a basic requirement of citizenship, but that other considerations may be considered, and absolutely equal districts are not mandated
    - Malapportionment inevitably means vote dilution; those voters in the more populous district have proportionately less  influence in the political process than those in the small districts.
      - An individual's constitutionally protected right to cast an equally weighted vote cannot be denied even by a vote of a  majority of a State's electorat.

##### Gerrymandering
- Politics can be a consideration in districting, but discriminatory intent justifies judicial review.
- See *[Gaffney v. Cummings](link)*
  - Court indicated that it would be very reluctant to invalidate districts based on gerrymandering
- Must be a prima facie showing of discrimination
  - See *[Davis v. Bandemer](link)*
    - Challenge to state redistricting that produced disparate results for Democratic party were upheld, as for political redistricting claims to be judiciable.
    - There must be a prima facie showing of discrimination
    - Mere disparate results in one election were not sufficient

##### After Davis
- See *[Vieth v. Jubelirer](link)*
  - Plurality argued that political gerrymandering claims should categorically be non- judiciable)

#### Access to the Judicial System
- Constitution does not require Access to Courts

##### Economic Barriers and the Criminal Process
- Transcripts on Appeal
  - See *[Griffin v. Illinois](link)*
    - Held that state must provide a trial transcript to indigent criminal defendant appealing conviction. Though noted that appeals are not constitutionally required, when permitted, cannot discriminate on account of wealth.
- Counsel on Appeal
  - See *[Douglas v. California](link)*
    - Held that states must provide indigent with counsel for their first appeal where appeals are granted
- There is no absolute right to counsel for appeals
  - See *[Ross v. Moffitt](link)*
  - Held that the indigent do not have to be provided with counsel for discretionary appeals – indigent still have meaningful access
