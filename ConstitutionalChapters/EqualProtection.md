  - Rational Basis

#### Rational Basis Review
- **"Why Me?"**
  1. Legitimate State Purpose
  2. Substantial Deference to Legislature
  3. Reasonably Related
- Note: Animus Concern


#### Deference to a Rational Basis
- The government has a legitimate purpose if it advances a traditional “police” purpose: protecting safety, public health, or public  morals.
- Under & Overinclusive laws allow legislature to take "small steps" toward figuring out a problem. Court is willing to tolerate some overinclusiveness and some underinclusiveness
when utilizing rational basis.
  - Safety
    - See *[Railway Express Agency v. New York](link)*
      - Upholding law banning certain advertising vehicles because city "might perceive" them to be a danger in traffic
        - "It is no requirement of equal protection that all evils of the same genus be eradicated or none at all"
    - See *[NY Transit Authority v. Beazer](link)*
      - Restricting unsafe drivers for administrative efficiency of excluding all methadone users instead of running drug screening.
  - Health
    - See *[Williamson v. Lee Optical](link)*
      - Upholding law preventing certain opticians from making new glasses. Legislature may have concluded this "potentially advanced" public health
    - See *[New Orleans v. Dukes](link)*
      - Keeping street vendors from dirtying streets
  - Morality

#### Exception for classification based on "animus"
- Express purpose of discriminating against hippies, homosexuals, or other undesirables is not legitimate purpose
  - See *[U.S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno]*
    - Purpose of increasing agricultural economy was legitimate but failed because wholly unrelated to rule.
- See *[NY Transit Authority v. Beazer](link)*
  - Restricting unsafe drivers


#### Deferrence for Economic Matters so long as Conceivable Legitimate Purpose
- See *[U.S. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz](link)*
  - The Supreme Court upheld a federal law designed to prevent retired railroad workers from receiving benefits under both the  Social Security system and the railroad retirement system.
  - Where as here, there are plausible reasons for Congress's action, our inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, constitutionally   irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlies the legislative decision because this Court never has insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute. This is particularly true where the legislature must necessarily  engage in a process of line drawing.

#### Rationality Review with Bite
- No tolerance for under or overinclusivity - Regardless of your purpose, Court will apply stricter scrutiny anyway
  - When Reasons are not believed, Court will invoke Rational Basis with a Bite
    - See *[Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal v. Webster County](link)*
    - See *[USDA v. Moreno](link)*


### Race Discrimination
- Historic Background was to specifically protect African-Americans
  - Elimination of Race as a Discriminatory Category
    - See *[Strauder v. West Viginia](link)*

#### Separate but Equal
- Court sustained an 1890 Louisiana law that required "equal but separate accommodations" for white and colored railroad passengers
  - See: *[Plessy v. Ferguson](link)*
    - First: the Thirteenth Amendment only applied to labor systems.
    - Second: the Fourteenth Amendment abolished legal but not social distinctions between races. “Separate but equal” does not impose a “badge of inferiority.”

#### Setup to Brown
- The NAACP advanced two arguments against “separate but equal.”
  - Most states did not attempt to show that separate facilities were actually equal, so the NAACP hoped the “separate but equal” defense would be unavailing.
  - Genuinely separate but equal facilities would be awesomely expensive and ultimately impossible.
    - Tangible v. Intagible qualities of facilities and equality
      - See *[Sweatt v. Painter](link)*
    - Restrictions on learning and to engage in study is not equal
      - See *[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents](link)*

#### Brown v. Board of Ed
- The Court heard Brown and four companion cases during the 1952 term. In 1953, it set the cases for reargument, possibly because the Court was badly split on the outcome. Before reargument, Chief Justice Vinson died and Chief Justice Warren took his place.
  - A “Dissent” from Brown: The Southern Manifesto
      - The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend it to affect education. Indeed, the Amendment’s authors were the same men who voted to segregate Washington, D.C.’s schools.
      - The members of the Court “undertook to exercise their naked political power and substituted their personal political and social ideas for the established law of the land.”
  - Parties’ arguments about the history and intent of the Fourteenth Amendment do not sufficiently resolve the issue.
  - “To separate them (i.e., black students) from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.”
  - Held: “in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”
  - **Record Testimony extensively used in determining Opinion**
    - See: *[Brown v. Board of Education (Brown 1)](Link)*


#### Meaning & Implications of Brown
- Separate but Equal & The Due Process Clause
  - On the same day as Brown, the Court held that segregation in DC’s public schools violated due process because it arbitrarily deprives black students of liberty (presumably, to pursue education)
  - Utilization of Reverse Incorporation
    - See *[Bolling v. Sharpe]*

#### Theory of Brown

#### Racial Discrimination Against Racial Minorities
- Declared clearly unconstitutional
  - But court left the door open.
    - Government cannot use race in a subordinate way but in some circumstances race can be used
      - See *[Korematsu v. United States](link)*
    - Travel Ban
      - See *[Trump v. Hawaii]*



#### Racially Discriminatory Purpose & Effect
- Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and and unequal hand so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances the denail of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.
  - See *[Yick Wo v. Hopkins](link)*


#### Facially Neutral Laws with Racially Discriminatory Effect
- That  there  must  be proof of a discriminatory purpose in order for such laws to be treated as racial or national origin classifications.
  - See *[Washington v. Davis](link)*

#### Meaning & Implication of Washington v. Davis
- Demonstrating Discriminatory Effect
  - Impact so clearly discriminatory as to allow no other explaination than that it was adopted for impermissible purposes
  - Historical Context
  - Legislative or Administrative History
    - See *[Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.]*
- Shifting Burden to Government
  - Demonstration that Government would have taken the same action regardless of race or national origin.

#### Legislative History & Evidence of Discrimination for a Facially Neutral Law
  - See *[Rogers v. Lodge](link)*
  - See *[Hunter v. Underwood](link)*

### Affirmative Action
- UC Davis’s affirmative action plan was unconstitutional. However, race is not categorically off limits.
  - See *[Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke](link)*
  - Diversity is a compelling interest in education and universities may use race as a factor to ensure diversity, but quotas or   numerical quantification of benefits is impermissible.
- Five Justices—Justice Powell on equal protection grounds and four Justices on statutory grounds—found impermissible the University of California at  Davis  Medical  School's  set-aside  of  16  slots in the entering class of 100 for minority students.
  - Justice  Powell said that the University of California at Davis Medical School could use race as one criterion in  admissions decisions.
    - Requires a Strict Scruitiny Analysis
      - “Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination"
        - Requires **Compelling Interest**
    - The Davis program had four goals:
      1. Reduce the historic deficit of minorities in medical school and the medical profession.
      2. Counter the effects of societal discrimination.
      3. Increase the number of physicians who will work in underserved communities.
      4. Obtain the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.
  - The Court held that all but the last were unconstitutional. It held that a system like Harvard’s, which awards a “plus” to minority applicants, would be permissible—but a quota system like Davis’s is not allowed.
- Dissenting Judges
  - Intermediate Scruitiny for Remedial Purposes
    - **Substantially Related** Requriement for the achievement of those objectives
      - Problems arising from Stigmitization
      - Powerless to escape immutible characteristics
  - Justice Blackmun, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
    - Race-neutral affirmative action is impossible. “In order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.
    - Justice Marshall, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
      - Marshall began with a long history of racial inequality in the US. That history created a range of present inequalities.
      - The Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit remedies for past discrimination.
