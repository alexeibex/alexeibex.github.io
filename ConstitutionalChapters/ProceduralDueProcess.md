## Procedural Due Process & The Right to a Hearing
#### Defining Liberty & Property
- Denial of Sustantive Due process denies an implicit right to one's "property" or "liberty" interest given by Federal Statute or State Statute.
- Guarantee of Due Process in the Deprivation of government benefits.
- The Supreme Court held that individuals receiving welfare have a property interest in continued  receipt  of  benefits  and  the  government  must  provide  due process before it terminates benefits.
  - See *[Goldberg v. Kelly](link)*
    - Holding that due process required that a welfare recipient be afforded an evidentiary hearing *before* the termination of benefits.
- Restriction of Due Process hearing rights to all manner of government entitlements
  - See *[Board of Regents v. Roth](link)*
    - Holding a nontenured teacher hired for one year at a campus of Wisconsin State University had no constitutional right to a statement of reasons and a hearing before being denied a rehire.
    - No claim of rights grounded in statute like in *[Goldberg](link)*
- State law creating entitlement not always fatal to a due process claim
  - See *[Perry v. Sindermann](link)*
    - Nontenured college teacher won a procedural due process right to a hearing on the sufficiency of the grounds for his nonretention because college had a **defacto** tenure program and professor claimed he had right under said program.
- Requirement of Hearing in the process of delineating the existence of the property interest
  - See *[Arnett v. Kennedy](link)*
    - Rejecting a nonprobationary federal civil service employee's claim to a full hearing prior to dismissal, because the procedure itself was delineated by federal statute and employee must take the "**bitter with the sweet"**

- Bitter with the Sweet Principle
- Concept failed to command a majority of the Court
  - See *[Bishop v. Wood](link)*
    - Dismissal of a policeman did not implicate any "property" or "liberty" interest requiring a hearing to determine the sufficieny of the cause.
  - Upheld & Settling the bitter with the sweet approach misconception later State procedures contained in the law creating the property rights are not the source of the consitutionally required procedures upon termination of the property right.
  - The Due Process Clause provides that certain substantive rights, life, liberty, and property cannot be deprived except pursuant to constituionally adequate procedures
    - See *[Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill](link)*

- Roth line of cases does not protect against deprivation of all government benefits, but only of "entitlements" created by state law.

- Rejecting an enforcable property interest claim by a citizen of a state for due process purposes in police enforcement of a restraining order.
  - Court deferrs to state law in delineating constitutionally protected property rights.
  - See *[Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales](link)*

- Procedural Due Process & Liberty
  - Restrictive Reading of Liberty
    - Holding that plaintiff, whom the local police had distributed flyers to local merchants labelling her an "active shoplifter" suffered no deprivation of liberty from her reputation.
    - Reputation alone is not a constitutionally protected interest.
      - See *[Paul v. Davis](link)*
  - Further Restrictions on "Liberty"
    - No denail of "liberty" when rejected from a Credit Card without any explaination.
    - See *[Kerry v. Din](link)*

#### What Process Is "Due"
- When Deprivation occurs what Procedrual Guarantees attach?
  - Holding that pretermination evidentiary hearings were not required in the context of disability benefits.
    - Due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.
      - Requires analysis of governmental and private interests that are affected.
        - See [Mathews v. Eldridge](link)*
  - Generally, additional process to certain protected interests is an ex ante hearing: The individual is given an opporunity to contest that decsion before the deprivation actually occurs
    - Weighing the Government's interest in proceeding without a hearing where a refigeration company argued that a local ordinace allowing inspectors to destroy potentially contaminated meats without an ex ante hearing deprived the company of a property interest in its meats without due process.
    - Court held circumstances demand the "destruction of food" not fit for human use constituted an emergency and that reaonsable discretion of the legislature could be afforded prior to a hearing.
      - See *[North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago](link)*
- Opposite where there is little need for rapid government action
  - See *[Perry v. Sindermann](link)*
  - Student challening a school's corporal punishment policy after student was "paddled" was upheld and did not implicate a "constitutional protected liberty interest"
  - See *[Ingrahm v. Wright](link)*
