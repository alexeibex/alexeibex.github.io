A. Congressional Power to Reach Private Interference with Constitutional Rights
(876-86) (.5 class)
1.United States v. Guest
a.Facts:
i.On July 11, 1964 Lt. Col. Lemuel Penn was shot and killed by three members of the Ku Klux Klan while driving home from Washington, D.C. The alleged shooters, James Lackey, Cecil Myers, and Howard Sims, were indicted but acquitted by an all-white jury. Following the acquittal, the three defendants were indicted on charges of conspiracy to threaten, abuse, and kill African Americans. Three alleged co-conspirators, Denver Phillips, George Turner, and Herbert Guest, were also charged. The U.S. Code defines criminal conspiracy as two or more individuals conspiring to "injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States." The indictment filed against the six alleged conspirators accused them of acting to deny African Americans full and equal enjoyment and utilization of goods and services, including access to state highways and free travel to and from Georgia on public streets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that it did not allege a specific denial of rights under U.S. law.
a.Procedural:
i.The district court agreed, and dismissed the indictment. The prosecution appealed, arguing that the indictment alleged, in part, a denial of rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
a.Issue:
i.Was the federal indictment based on an offense under the laws of the United States?
b.Reasoning:
i.The Court reasoned that the indictment contained an express allegation of state involvement sufficient at least to require denial of a motion to dismiss. If the predominate purpose of the conspiracy is to prevent the exercise of the right of travel, or to oppress a person of that right, as was the case here, then whether or not motivated by racial discrimination, the conspiracy becomes a proper object of federal law under which the indictment was brought. Therefore, the federal indictment was based on an offense under the laws of the United States.
c.Arguments:
d.Holding:
i.The Court held that a criminal conspiracy affecting an individual's right of free interstate passage violated the law.

i.If raised in Puerto Rico, then can vote in NY, even with the English literacy requirement to vote in NY

c.Reasoning:
i.Two rationales
1.Enabling the Puerto Rican community to protect itself from government power
a.If they have the right to vote then they can protect themselves from discrimination
2.Congress under 14th enforcement power can decide for itself that certain practice constitute as invidious discrimination under the constitution

#### Congressional Legislation based on the enforcement clause must be remedial.
- Congress lacks the power “to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation.”
  - Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides Congress only with remedial powers, and when upholding a constitutional right, Congress may only enforce legislation that utilizes means proportional to achieving that legislative purpose.
    - See *[City of Boerne v. Flores](link)*
      - Court expressly rejected this view and shifted to the federalist perspective that Congress may not use its §5 powers to expand the scope of rights or to create new rights.
      - How does Boerne help predict how the Court will rule in *[Shelby County v. Holder](link)*?
- The coverage formula found in § 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is
facially unconstitutional.
- A federal law that departs from the fundamental principles of federalism must be justified by current needs
  - See *[Shelby County v. Holder](link)*

### Congress's Power to Authorize Suits Against State Governments
- To what extent can Congress abrogate state 11th amendment "Sovereign Immunity"
-
#### The Eleventh Amendment and Congress’s Power to Override It
- The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizensof  another  State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign  state.” The Supreme  Court long has interpreted this provision as barring suits against state governments without their consent both by their  own citizens and by citizens of other states.

#### Congruence & Proportionality
- **Congruence**
  - Federal action using §5 must target the actual §1 civil rights violation.
- **Proportionality**
  - Federal action using §5 must be proportionate to the harm. Otherwise Congress could effectively extend the scope of a right by legislating a measure that sweeps within it, and bans, otherwise constitutional conduct all in the name of protecting that right.
  - See *[United States v. Morrison](link)*

#### Legislation is not generally remedial if the classifications are not heightened or suspect:
- **Age**
  - See *[Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents](link)*
    - Strikes down legislation permitting state employees to sue states for age discrimination
      - Violates proportionality and congruence test, and insufficient evidence of discrimination
- **Disability**
  - See *[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett](link)*
    - Invalidating Section I of ADA for creating cause of action against states for disability status. Finds that there was insufficient evidence of discrimination, and it was not congruent/proportional
  - See *[Tennessee v. Lane](link)*
    - **BUT** upholding section II of the ADA, finding that fundamental rights, such as access to courts, were at stake. There was a history of discrimination, and it is congruent and proportional.
      - Court recognized that Congress has greater latitude to legislate under §5 when dealing with a claim that receives heightened judicial scrutiny, whether because it is a fundamental right or a type of discrimination that receives heightened scrutiny.
      - Scalia: "Flabby Tests"
- **Gender Discrimination**
  - See *[Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs](link)*
    - Upholds family and medical leave act, grounding it in history of discrimination against women. Finds it is congruent and proportional
  - BUT: **Family Leave & Self Care**
    - See *[Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland](link)*
      - Whereas Hibbs found that the family leave provision was meant to remedy sex discrimination, and thus fit within  Congress's §5 power,“[t]he same cannot be said for requiring the States to give all employees the opportunity to take self-care   leave.... Without widespread evidence of sex discrimination or sex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave, it is  apparent that the congressional purpose in enacting the self-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs.

#### Pendulum Swing
  - Since Katzenbach, Pendulum has swung back so that court requires a stricter adherence to determine the right, the remedy & measuring the congruence & proportionality
