## The Post-Civil War Amendments and the "Incorporation of Fundamental Rights"
- Separation of Powers was to protect individual rights through strcutural means
  - Theory was governed that government power was **so limited** it would be hard for it to become a totalitarian regime.
  - At ratification there was no need for a Bill of Rights
    - Pass basic Constitution, upon passing Bill of Rights will get passed
      - 1-10 Ratified and then Bill of Rights After
        - See [Bill of Rights](link)
- Bill of Rights
  - 1-8 provide for individual rights
  - 9 & 10 focus on enumeration and extension of rights
  - 11-14 Civil War Amendments
    - Relationship of Original 1-8 compared to the Civil War Amendments and limitations on State Government

### Individual Rights Before the Civil War

#### Scope of the Constitution
- Bill of Rights applied **only to the Federal Government**, not to the State & Local governments
  - Restrictions only applicable to Federal Actions not state and local conduct
  - "The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states"
  - 5th Amendment does not apply.
    - "Congress shall make no law..."
    - Textual Argument only a few places in reference to the federal government but no intent by framers to cover state's and local law.
    - See *[Barron v. Maryor and City Council of Baltimore](link)*


#### Slavery and Individual Rights
  - First Issue - Dred Scott is a citizen?
    - Diversity Jurisdiction between citizens of different states
      - No, Examines the framers treatment of slaves during the ratification of the Constitution and therefore Dred Scot is not a citizen of US.
  - Tawney attempt to fix the issue, set it right and solve the slavery problem
    - Congress cannot pass law to free slaves, infringement of 5th Amendment and take property without due process of law.
      - Slaves = Property
  - First example of a substantive due process issue.
    - Where court examines the reason behind due process questions.
  - Dissent: Born in free state = Citizen of the United States.
  - Aftermath: One of the "causes of the Civil War"
    - Sets in motion Civl War 3 years later
  - Invalidation of an act of Congress and declaring an issue beyond the reach of the political branches.
    - See *[Dred Scott v. Sandford](link)*

### The Post Civil-War Amendments

#### Slaughter House Cases
- Emphasizing the Civil War Amendements had not been meant to expand radically the power of the Supreme Court to regulate the relationship of the states to their own citizens.
  - 14th Amendment: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States
    - See *[Slaughter-House Cases](link)*

#### Revival of Privileges & Immunities Clause
- Privileges & Immunities to protect the right to travel
  - The free movement among the free States is acknowledged as a basic liberty.
  - See *[Saenz v. Roe](link)*

### The "Incorporation" of the Bill of Rights Through the Due Process Clause
- Articulating the case for "selective" incorporation,
  - See *[Palko v. Connecticut](link)*

#### Incorporation Since Duncan
- The Scope of Incorporated Rights
  - See *[Duncan v. Louisiana](link)*
- What Rights have been incorporated?
- Incorporation and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms
  - Court vacating the convictions of members of a white mob for dispossessing African-Americans of their guns & holding that the 2nd Amendment did not apply except as against the federal government.
    - See *[United States v. Cruikshank](link)*
  - Upholding the conviction under the National Firearms Act, holding that the regulated weapons lacked any "reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia"
    - See *[United States v. Miller](link)*
  - First tiem court enforced the Amendment expressly as a matter of individual rights,
  - Holding that Miller did not foreclose "adoption of the original understanding of the Second Amendment" Court invalidated a DC law that effectively banned the possession of handguns.
  - Reasoned that because DC is governed by the federal government, the Court did not need to reach the question whether the 2nd amedment is incorporated under due process so as to apply to state or city gun ordinances.
  - See *[District of Columbia v. Heller](link)*

#### The Second Amendment and the Due Process Clause
  - Holding that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment incorporates the 2nd Amendment Right recognized in Heller
    - See *[McDonald v. City of Chicago](link)*
#### Meaning and Implications of Heller and McDonald
- History and Incorporation
- Guns and American History
- The level of scrutiny for the Second Amendment Claims
