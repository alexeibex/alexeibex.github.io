## The Post-Civil War Amendments and the "Incorporation of Fundamental Rights"
- Separation of Powers was to protect individual rights through strcutural means
  - Theory was governed that government power was **so limited** it would be hard for it to become a totalitarian regime.
  - At ratification there was no need for a Bill of Rights
    - Pass basic Constitution, upon passing Bill of Rights will get passed
      - 1-10 Ratified and then Bill of Rights After
        - See [Bill of Rights](link)

  - 9 & 10 focus on enumeration and extension of rights
  - 11-14 Civil War Amendments
    - Relationship of Original 1-8 compared to the Civil War Amendments and limitations on State Government

### Individual Rights Before the Civil War

#### Scope of the Constitution
- Bill of Rights applied **only to the Federal Government**, not to the State & Local governments
  - Restrictions only applicable to Federal Actions not state and local conduct
  - "The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states"
  - 5th Amendment does not apply.
    - "Congress shall make no law..."
    - Textual Argument only a few places in reference to the federal government but no intent by framers to cover state's and local law.
    - See *[Barron v. Maryor and City Council of Baltimore](link)*


#### Slavery and Individual Rights
  - First Issue - Dred Scott is a citizen?
    - Diversity Jurisdiction between citizens of different states
      - No, Examines the framers treatment of slaves during the ratification of the Constitution and therefore Dred Scot is not a citizen of US.
  - Tawney attempt to fix the issue, set it right and solve the slavery problem
    - Congress cannot pass law to free slaves, infringement of 5th Amendment and take property without due process of law.
      - Slaves = Property
  - First example of a substantive due process issue.
    - Where court examines the reason behind due process questions.
  - Dissent: Born in free state = Citizen of the United States.
  - Aftermath: One of the "causes of the Civil War"
    - Sets in motion Civl War 3 years later
  - Invalidation of an act of Congress and declaring an issue beyond the reach of the political branches.
    - See *[Dred Scott v. Sandford](link)*

### The Post Civil-War Amendments

#### Slaughter House Cases
- Emphasizing the Civil War Amendements had not been meant to expand radically the power of the Supreme Court to regulate the relationship of the states to their own citizens.
  - 14th Amendment: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States
    - See *[Slaughter-House Cases](link)*

#### Revival of Privileges & Immunities Clause
- Privileges & Immunities to protect the right to travel
  - The free movement among the free States is acknowledged as a basic liberty.
  - See *[Saenz v. Roe](link)*
