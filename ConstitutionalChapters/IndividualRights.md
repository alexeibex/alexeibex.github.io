## The Post-Civil War Amendments and the "Incorporation of Fundamental Rights"
- Separation of Powers was to protect individual rights through strcutural means
  - Theory was governed that government power was **so limited** it would be hard for it to become a totalitarian regime.
  - At ratification there was no need for a Bill of Rights
    - Pass basic Constitution, upon passing Bill of Rights will get passed
      - 1-10 Ratified and then Bill of Rights After
        - See [Bill of Rights](link)
- Bill of Rights
  - 1-8 provide for individual rights
  - 9 & 10 focus on enumeration and extension of rights
  - 11-14 Civil War Amendments
    - Relationship of Original 1-8 compared to the Civil War Amendments and limitations on State Government

### Individual Rights Before the Civil War
- Bill of Rights Relatively Weak and Not applied to the States
#### Scope of the Constitution
- Bill of Rights applied **only to the Federal Government**, not to the State & Local governments
  - Restrictions only applicable to Federal Actions not state and local conduct
  - "The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states"
  - The 5th Amendment does not apply to State Government
    - "Congress shall make no law..."
    - Textual Argument only a few places in reference to the federal government but no intent by framers to cover state's and local law.
      - See *[Barron v. Maryor and City Council of Baltimore](https://github.com/alexeibex/alexeibex.github.io/blob/master/constitutionallaw.md#case-barron-v-mayor-and-city-council-of-baltimore)*

### Post Civil War Amendments
#### Slavery and Individual Rights
  - First Issue - Dred Scott is a citizen?
    - Diversity Jurisdiction between citizens of different states
      - No, Examines the framers treatment of slaves during the ratification of the Constitution and therefore Dred Scot is not a citizen of US.
  - Tawney attempt to fix the issue, set it right and solve the slavery problem
    - Congress cannot pass law to free slaves, infringement of 5th Amendment and take property without due process of law.
      - Slaves = Property
  - First example of a substantive due process issue.
    - Where court examines the reason behind due process questions.
  - Dissent: Born in free state = Citizen of the United States.
  - Aftermath: One of the "causes of the Civil War"
    - Sets in motion Civl War 3 years later
  - Invalidation of an act of Congress and declaring an issue beyond the reach of the political branches.
    - See *[Dred Scott v. Sandford](link)*

### The Post Civil-War Amendments
- 13th, 14th & 15th
  - 13th - Codified the Emancipation Proclamation
  - 14th - Overruled Dred Scott and Made all persons born in the United States citizens
  - 15th - Explicitly about racial discrimination in voting

#### The 14th Amendment
  - Section 1:
    - Overrules Dred Scott Decision
    - "**No State shall make** or enforce any law which shall abridge..." (inclusive of localities)
    - "Nor shall any deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process..." (copied from 5th amendment)
    - "Nor deny any person...the equal protection of the laws"


#### The Slaughter House Cases
- Narrow Interpretation of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment
- Emphasizing the Civil War Amendements had not been meant to expand radically the power of the Supreme Court to regulate the relationship of the states to their own citizens.
- Instead amendments are focused on slavery not butchers claim right to practice their livelihood
  - Focus: 14th Amendment: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States
  - Intent of 2 separate sources of rights. States and Federal Citizen
    - Article 4 § 2 - Other states discrimination against citizens of other states.
    - Priviligies and Immunities does NOT include the right to work and does not protect allocation and discrimination by one's own state. US citizens have passport and petition rights.
    - States should be given the ability to create laws regarding "good lift rights"
- Dissent
  - All of section 1 was designed to create equality between/among the several states.
  - "The privileges and immunities designated are those which of right belong to the citizens of all free governments."
    - Both Article 4 Section 2 & 14th Amendment protect the good life rights
      - Article 4 protect intrastate
      - Amendment 14th Protects within one's own state
    - Modern Interpreataion = Equal Opportunity
    - See *[Slaughter-House Cases](link)*
  - Privileges & Immunity was rendered a nullity after *[Slaughter House Cases](link)*

#### Revival of Privileges & Immunities Clause
- Privileges & Immunities to protect the right to travel
- Source based on the equal protection cluse.
  - The free movement among the free States is acknowledged as a basic liberty irrespective of how long you have been there
    - Right to Come and Go
    - Right to be treated fairly
      - See *[Piper Case](link)*
    - Right to migrate to a new state
  - See *[Saenz v. Roe](link)*

### The "Incorporation" of the Bill of Rights Through the Due Process Clause
- Articulating the case for "selective" incorporation
- Articulating the case for "total" incorporation
- Early Battles Through Criminal Prosecution in State Courts
- Formula to Incorporate Rights through the Due Process Clause
  - **Fundamental Rights** = "Principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental" / "Ordered Liberty"
- Citique: What does process have to do with "free speech"?
  - Liberty
- Double Jeopardy
  - See *[Palko v. Connecticut](link)*
- Self-Incriminiation
  - See *[Adamson v. California](link)*
    - Justice Frankfurter's Flexible Due Process Approach: "Not based on the idiosyncrasies of merely personal judgement"
      - Examines the surrounding context and custom by states in incororation
    - Justice Black Dissent: Due Process requires "total incorporation of the Bill of Rights"
      - Must be in the Bill Of Rights or else not extended

#### Incorporation Since Duncan
- The Scope of Incorporated Rights
  - Incorporated Bill of Rights guarantees are “enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same  standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment. Thus, if a Bill of Rights protection is  incorporated, there is no day light between the federal and state conduct it prohibits or requires.""
- Trial By Jury
  - See *[Duncan v. Louisiana](link)*
- What Rights have been incorporated?


#### Incorporation and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms
  - Court vacating the convictions of members of a white mob for dispossessing African-Americans of their guns & holding that the 2nd Amendment did not apply except as against the federal government.
    - See *[United States v. Cruikshank](link)*
  - Upholding the conviction under the National Firearms Act, holding that the regulated weapons lacked any "reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia"
    - See *[United States v. Miller](link)*
  - First time court enforced the Amendment expressly as a matter of individual rights,
  - Holding that Miller did not foreclose "adoption of the original understanding of the Second Amendment" Court invalidated a DC law that effectively banned the possession of handguns.
  - Reasoned that because DC is governed by the federal government, the Court did not need to reach the question whether the 2nd amendment is incorporated under due process so as to apply to state or city gun ordinances.
    - See *[District of Columbia v. Heller](link)*
      - 2nd Amendment fundamental to the scheme of ordered liberty, deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions
      - Scalia Majority Focus on the ownership of arms as opposed to militia.
        - Still concedes limits to ownership and use.

#### The Second Amendment and the Due Process Clause
  - Holding that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment incorporates the 2nd Amendment Right recognized in Heller for States
    - Incorporation through the Due Process
    - See *[McDonald v. City of Chicago](link)*
      - Thomas: 2nd Amendment applies through the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause not through "Process"
        - Ownership of gun is a "substantive right"
      - Dissent:

#### Meaning and Implications of Heller and McDonald
- History and Incorporation
- Guns and American History
- The level of scrutiny for the Second Amendment Claims


#### 8th Amendment Incorporation
- See *[Timbs v. Indiana](link)*
  - 8th Amendment Ban against excessive fines is incorporated
  - Deeply rooted in traditions & necessary for ordered liberty.
