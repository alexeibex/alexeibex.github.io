## Economic Liberties & The Takings Clause
- Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment
  - See *[Barrons v. City of Baltimore](link)*
  - Private property shall not "be taken for public use, without just compensation"
- Incorporated through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment and extended to States.

### Takings Clause
- Applies to both Federal & State Government
  - Federal Government through 5th Amendment
  - State Government through 14th Amendment
- 4 Elements:
  - **Property**
    - Tangible v. Intangible Property
  - Has it been "**taken**"?
    - Bulldozer taking v. Regulatory taking
  - For "**Public Use?**"
    - Use by the Public v. Public Purpose
  - **Just Compensation**

### Interpreting the Takings Clause
#### The "Public Use" Requirement
- Judicial Deference toward Determinations of "public use"
  - Supreme Court has extended the same deference toward legislative determinations of what constitutues "public use" as it does under economic due process scrutiny
  - Upholding a DC law authorizing the taking of private property for the purpose of redeveloping blighted urban areas after which the government could lease or sell the property to private developers required to conform to redevelopment plans adopted by the DC agency
    - Public welfare is Broad and Inclusive and up to the legislature to decide
      - See *[Berman v. Parker](link)*
  - Upholding Hawaii's use of eminent domain to solve the problem of concentrated land ownership.
    - See *[Hawaii Housing Authority v. Mikiff](link)*
  - Reaffirmed that a taking is for “public use” so long as the government acts out of a reasonable belief that the taking will benefit  the  public.
    - See *[Kelo v. City of New London](link)

#### Meaning and Implications of Kelo
  - Broad Reading of "Public Use"
    - Not just inclusive of actual public use but also includes public development
  - The Law and Economics of takings for Public Use
  - Public Response to Kelo
  - State Constitutional Interpretation of Public Use
  - Racial equality and Eminent Domain

#### Regulatory Takings
  - No condemnation of property but regulates its use and substantially diminishes its value
    - Balance between taking and regulation that equates takings
  - The general rule at least is, that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.
    - See *[Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon](link)*

#### Meaning and Implications of Pennsylvania Coal
- Distinguishing permissible regulations from regulatory takings
  - Opposite to Pennsylvania Coal, Court upheld against takings challenge a Virginia law that provided for the destruction of a pulbic nuisance of all ornamental red ceder trees that were or might be the source of a communicable plant disease growing by an apple orchird.
  - The state does not exceed its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class of property in order to save another which,  in  the  judgment  of  the  legislature,  is  of  greater  value  to  the public
  - See *[Miller v. Schoene](link)*
- Later not following the Mahon apporach upholding a modern day law = to Kohler act and struck down PA law prohibiting coal mining that caused subsidence damage to preexsiting public buildings, dwellings, and cemateries.
  - See *[Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. Debenedictis](link)*

#### Scope of Property under "Takings" Clause
- Penn Central Balancing Test
  - Holding a New York City preservation law designating the Grand Central Terminal building a "landmark" constituted a permissible regulation not compensable taking.
  - Regulation did not deny owners all profitable use of the building and, in fact, had not precluded all development of air rights above building.
  - Only decreased value but also had an important purpose that benefited the public.
    - See *[Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City]

#### Per Se Takings
- A per se rule for "permanent phyiscal occupations"
  - Holding that when the government authorizes a permanent physical occupation if "minor one" of an owner's property there is a taking without regard to the public interests that may serve. Invaldiating Ne york law that provided that a landlord must permit a cable telebision company to install cable wire upon a property.
    - When faced with a constitutional challenge to a permanent physical occupation of real property, this Court   hasinvariably found a taking
      - See *[Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.](link)*

- A per se rule for regulations denying "all economically beneficial use"
- Court set forth virtually per se rule of invalidity for "confiscatory regulations"
  - See *[Lucas v. South Carolina Costal Council](link)*
    - Regulatory takings and the timing of Government Action
    - Mere invalidation of the regulation restricting the use of the property was a consitutionally insufficient remedy when the government regulation proves sufficiently burdensome to constitute a takings.
- See *[First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. Los Angeles County](link)*
  - Holding a property owner could challenge as a regulatory taking restrictions on his property that had originally been imposed prior to his acquisition of that property
    - See *[Palazzolo v. Rhode Island](link)*
- Holding that a temporary development ban would have to be evaluated case by case under the Penn Central Test rather than treated categorically as a taking under the per se rule of Lucas. Held that it would be upheld so long as it is reasonable.
  - See *[Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency](link)*

- Conditions on development permits as "takings"
  - Nexus Limitation that Condition must be roughly proportionate to the government's justification for regulating
    - A condition on a beachfront building permit to constitute a compensable taking.
      - See *[Nollan v. California Costal Comm'n](link)*
    - Clarifying Degree of Scruitiny applicable to conditional development exactions under the Taking Clause
    - Rough Proportionality Standard - The Burden created by the condition is roughly proportionate to the government's justification for regulating.
      - See *[Dolan v. CIty of Tigard](link)

#### Conclusions on Takings
- Court generally has been reluctant to find government regulations to be a taking.
  - Frequently and expressly has recognized that government would be unduly shackled if it had to compensate everytime it frustrated someone's expectations or decreased the value of somebody's property.

### Contracts Clause
- Prohibits any state "Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts"
  - Purpose: Government should not be able to rewrite contracts

#### Modern Contracts Test
- When a state or local government interferes with existing private contracts: 3 Part Test
  - is there a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship;
  - if so does it serve a significant and legitimate public purpose;
  - is it reasonbly related to achieving the goal;
- Government interference with Government Contracts will be subjected to a higher scruitiny
  - Laws impairing the government's obligations under its own contracts will be subjected to much more careful review than will law interfering with private contracts.
  - See *[United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey](link)*
