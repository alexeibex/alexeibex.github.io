### Authority of Judicial Review
#### Marbury v. Madison: The Authority for Judicial Review of Congressional and Presidential Actions
- Establishing the authority for the judiciary to review the constitutionality of executive and legislative acts
  - Holding: Against Marbury and found it could not constitutionally hear the case as a matter of original jurisdiction. Although the legislative act authorized jurisdiction, the statute was unconstitutional because Congress cannot not allow for jurisdiction outside the scope of the USC.
    - See *[Marbury v. Madison](link)*

#### Authority for Judicial Review of State and Local Actions
- Supreme Court may review state court decisions established by case.
  - Presumption by the USC that the Supreme Court could review state court decisions
  - Essential to establish uniformity in the interpretation of federal law.
    - See *[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee](link)*
- Supreme Court's Ability to take cases from State Courts on Appeal
  - State courts could not be trusted to adequetly protect federal rights because state judges are dependent for office and salary at will of the state legislature.
    - See *[Cohens v. Virginia](link)*
- Decisions of the Supreme Court is the Law of the Land
  - Federal Courts also have the ability to review the Constitutionality of state laws and actions of state officials.
  - See *[Cooper v. Aaron]*

### Introduction of Justiciability Doctrines
- Determine which matters federal courts can hear and decide and which must be dismissed

#### Constitutional v. Prudential Requirements
- Standing Requirement
  - Whether plaintiff demonstrates an actual or imminent harm
- Mootness Requirement
  - Whether there still exists an actual dispute between parties
- Ripeness Requirement
  - Whether a dispute has occurred or whether it will occur in the near future for review.


- Sources of Rules
  - Interpretation of Article 3 Section 2
    - 9 Categories of "Cases and Controversies"
    - Constitutional Provisions
  - Prudent Judicial Adminsitration
    - Wise policy militates against judicial review
    - Can be altered by federal statute

#### Policy Underlying Justiciabilty Doctrines
- Separation of Powers
  - Court cannot inject itself into other branches of government unless there arises a case or controversy
- Conservation of Judicial Resources
  - Limited Resources
- Improve Judicial Decision Making
  - Ensures Concrete Controversies
- Promote Fairness
  - Unfair to adjudicate matters that affect more than just parties before the court.

### Prohibition on Advisory Positions
- Article 3 limitation on Federal Courts ability to issue advisory positions
  - Unlike states, who can issue positions to guide legislation and prevent unconstitutional laws from being passed.

#### Justifications for Preventing Advisory Positions
- Separation of Powers
  - Prohibits federal courts from interfering with Legislative Process and the Passage of Laws
    - Limited role to deciding actual disputes
  - Waste of Political and Financial Capital as dispute will arise if passage is successful
  - Results in questions presented to the court in specific terms not just hypothetical legal questions

#### Criteria to Avoid Being an Advisory Opinion
- Must be actual dispute between adverse litigants
- Substantial likelihood that decision in favor of claimant will bring about some kind of change or effect.
