## Introduction

### Hello World!
- I am currently a 2L at Brooklyn Law School where my background in technology has sent me on a path toward the intersection of law and technology. I am currently the President of [Brooklyn Law School's Legal Hackers](https://blslegalhackers.github.io/Home/) and work as a legal intern at [BetterCloud](https://www.bettercloud.com/).

### As a Law Student
- This past summer I had the great experience of working at Twitter as a legal intern, and got incredible insight into the diverse set of issues that surround a company like Twitter. 
- While there, I worked on issues related to:
   - Commerical Transactions
   - IP
   - Human Rights/Law Enforcement
   - Policy/Regulation
   - Product Counsel
   - Litigation
   - Privacy
### Before the Law
- Before I decided to go to law school, I worked at a startup company in the adtech space. It was there that I gained exposure to the data economy and working at a start up required me to wear many hats. Starting as in operations, I grew and learned as much as I could eventually moving into roles in Business Intelligence and Product Management.
