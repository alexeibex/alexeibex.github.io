# Property Law
Supplemental Reading: Gilberts Outline, Sprankling



## 1.0 Introduction
- <span style="color:red">**ENCOURAGE with INCENTIVSE DON'T Incentivize'**</span>

- Lee's theory of judgement: Attempt to provide results to the "parties before them"
  - Not actual maximization of social efficiency
  - Judges getting into the judging business = fairness
  - Sympethetic πs.
    - [Producers Lumber & Supply Co. v. Olney Building Co.](Link)


#### Class Themes:
No single unifying theory of property. Numerous older doctrines and rules that pervade modern facts and issues. Resurgent movement to change methodology and provide unfiying theory of property.


#### Questions
- Does an element of time matter?
- How long ago was it acquired?
- How it was acquired?
  - Trespass is wrong. But trespass long enough and acquire ownership.
- Transfer of ownership
  - Position in lines
    - DC circuit prohibited line standing for viewing cases
    - US Supreme Court banned line standing
- What sorts of things can be owned?
  - Should you own something if you are first?
  - If you suffered?
- Who determines the rules?
  - Law or Custom?


### 1.1 Acquisition and Claim Scope
Reading: Pages 57–69 & 72–82​

##### Acquisition & Ownership
- Real Property v. Personal Property
 - Real Property = Dirt & Buildings (Focus)
 - Personal Property = Personal Goods & Tangibles + IP

#### First/Subsequent Possession
#### Case: *[Pierson v. Post](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Court granted libellant fisherman judgment in action for conversion of fin-backwhale because local usage that fisherman who shoots a whale with identifiable bomb-lance, letting it sink, then pays fee to whale's finder, granted title.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Fin-backwhales frequent Massachusetts bay where fishermen shoot and kill the whales. Whales then sink to the ocean floor and rise up 1-3 days later. Whales then either float to beach, are picked up or float out to sea. Each fisherman uses their own unique lance to mark the whale. ∆ found such whale and advertised on the spot for the sale of the whale.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Can local custom allow for possession and claim of title.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Whale, being a ferae naturae, does not become property until a firm possession has been established by the taker.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>No Application of Pierson Test</li>
      </li>A custom among whalemen in the Arctic seas, that the iron holds the whale, is reasonable and valid to bestow title upon the party who first harpoons a whale. The usage for the first iron, whether attached to the boat or not, to hold the whale, is fully established.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Judgement Reversed. A whale is a ferae naturae (wild by nature) and that property of animals is acquired by <b>occupancy only</b>. Narrow question is what amounts to occupancy of acquiring right to wild animals?</li>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Application of rule for Pierson v. Post, Whale Company would lose
    - Mortal Wounding and non abandonment of pursuit - leaving whale results in breaking off pursuit.
    - Trapping to deprive of liberty
  - Whales are different than foxes
    - Context of chasing whale v. fox
  - Custom Prevails because it is reasonable and is necessary limited application.
    - Rule works in practice
    - Necessary to continue the industry or else no one would whale hunt.
  - Should judges follow custom even if it is contrary to law.
    - Legislation may not fall in line with custom.
    - Potential problems with Custom
      - Small group will develop a custom that is good for group but that it is not good for society as a whole.
        - Jim Crow Custom/Laws
        - Ivy League Admission on Jewish Applicants
      - What custom governs between competing customs?
        - Are judges likely able to understand nuiances of custom?
  - Case before court is to sort out custom v. legislation and provide clairty and issue settled.
    - Amount awarded was probably more to litigate than cost of damages.

#### 1.2 Open Access and the Commons
- *"The Tragedy of the Commons"*
- **Elinor Ostrom *Governing the Commons*
  - The degredation of the environment to be expected whenever many individuals use a scarce resource in common.
  - Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited.
- Modern Tragedy of the Commons
  - Overfishing
  - Pollution
  - Global Warming/CO2 Emissions
- Results in Overutilization
- **Solutions to the Tragedy of the Commons**
  1. Central Planning/Government/Corporation (Leviathan)
    - Inherently Coersive
    - Prone to Error due to lack of information
      - Microsoft v. Apple Example
        - Steve Balmer - "There is no chance that the iPhone will get any significant marketshare, no chance"
        - Microsoft had access to necessary resources to build mobile product and yet they completely failed.
  2. Private Property
    - Allows owner to internalize cost but reap the benefits of their own property.
    - Requires security, monitoring, and defense of property
    - Risk allocation problems
      - Plot may be in an area that is not beneficial
      - Requires insurance against risk
    - Property as a utilitarian solution
      - Incentive to invest and reap benefits
- Anti-Commons - Property can create problems of their own
  - Too many people have ownership of a resource
    - Can result in every person has a veto vote and impedes progress
  - Results in underutilization

## 2.0 Water Rights
Reading: Pages 57-69 & 72-82
#### Definition of Water
- Fugitive Resource with a flow that is only partly predictable.
- Renewable Resource
- Water law consists of a common law base with state statutory and federal overlays.
- Law Distinguishes water along two axes:
  - Surface v. Underground (Y Axis)
  - Diffuse v. In a defined channel/body (X Axis)
    - Diffuse treated as a pest
    - Defined Channel as a resource

### 2.1 Watercourses
- A riparian (relating to or situated on the banks of a river) owner = one whose land abuts the watercourse, and riparian water rights are apppurtenant to the land
  - The rights to the land and the right to use the water from the surface stream form a package that cannot be split up.
  - Natural Flow Theory v. Reasonable Use Theory
    - English law developed where each owner could prevent any diversion of the natural flow of a river or stream by an upstream riparian owner
    - American law adopts more flexible theory of reasonable use


### 2.2 Principles of Water Allocation
- Embodies and Underlies the just utilization of property
  1. Natural Flow
  2. Reasonable Use
  3. First Appropriation
  4. Corellative Use

### Natural Flow
  - Every riparian owner has equal access to water
  - Rests on implicit principle of just allocation of property rights
    - Where everyone gets an equal amount
  - Cons: Prevents the use of water for applications that removes water from water course.
  - Use of the water can be gained by getting permission from every riparian owner
  - Anti-Commons Problem
    - Incur Transaction costs/Hold out problems
  - Impededs productive use

### Reasonable Use
- Just allocation of property rights, promotes the reasonably social good uses.
- American reasonable use doctrine is like the law of nuisance in torts in the sense that a wide variety of contextual factors are relevant in determining whether a diversion is actionable.
  - Courts should consider the purpose of the use
  - Suitability to the water course
  - Economic and Social values at stake
  - Harm Caused
  - Possible accommodation techniques
  - Protection of existing investments
  - Ability of adversely affected riparians to bear the loss
  - Justice
- Riparian rights run with the land and cannot be severed.
  - Riparian Owner A cannot sell his rights to nonriparian owner B
    - Results in parceling of land for access to water (Bowling Alley Parcel)
- Problems: What is Reasonable?
  - *Evans v. Merriweather* draws distinction between natural wants and artifical wants.
    - Norms change - Artificial changes
      - Outhouses v. modern plumbling
    - Domestic v. Other

#### Case: *[Evans v. Merriweather](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-evans-v-merriweather-1667897126.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A judgment for plaintiff in an action for obstructing and diverting a water course was affirmed because defendant had not made a reasonable use of the running water and had injured plaintiff by diverting all of the water into his own well.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Merriweather against Evans for obstructing and diverting a water course.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can riparian proprietors use as much water as they want from a stream on their land?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> There may be, and there must be, of that which is common to all, a reasonable use. The true test of the principle and extent of the use is, whether it is to the injury of the other proprietors or not. There may be diminution in quantity, or a retardation or acceleration of the natural current, indispensable for the general and valuable use of the water, perfectly consistent with the use of the common right. The diminution, retardation, or acceleration, not positively and sensibly injurious, by diminishing the value of the common right, is an implied element in the right of using the stream at all. The law here, as in many other cases, acts with a reasonable reference to public convenience and general good, and is not betrayed into a narrow strictness, subversive of common use, nor into an extravagant looseness, which would destroy private rights. That of a thing common by nature, there may be an appropriation by general consent or grant. Mere priority of appropriation of running water, without such consent or grant, confers no exclusive right.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Affirmed with cost. The Court held that without a contract or a grant, neither owner has a right to use all the water, because all have a right to participate in its benefits. Because of this, the upstream owner may only use as much as is necessary to satisfy his natural needs, and has to leave enough for the downstream owner's natural needs. This is because while manufactures promote the prosperity and comfort of mankind, it is not considered absolutely necessary to his existence, nor is the machinery which would be used from the water power.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Justice upon the whole has been done and because damages are so small, the case should not be sent back for a jury to consider.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Application of Priciples
    - First Posession Theory
      - Evans gets the water before Merriweather
      - Evans "owned" steam mill before Merriweather who accquried from Smith & Baker
      - Merriweather would have claim over water rights through building first steam mill
    - Natural Flow Theory
      - Rejected
    - Reasonable Use
      - Both have a right so long as both uses are:
        - Reasonable AND;
        - Does not injury any other riparian owner than is necessary to accomplish reasonable use.
      - Natural v. Artificial Use
        - Water for needs (drinking)
        - Water for comfort & prosperity
        - Natural use > Artificial Use


### First Appropriation
- Whoever is first gets the right.
- Promotes economic development & efficiency
- Statutory Application
- Generally only "beneficial uses" of appropriated water are permitted.
  - Water to flood gophers on land?
- Gives rights to use water in a certain way for a certain period of time - rather than a right to a certain volume of water.
- Water measured in cubic foot per second.
- Eastern v Western Applications
  - Western = Evolved from consumptive water use
  - Eastern = Evolved from water for power non-zero sum game.

#### Case: *[Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-coffin-v-left-hand-ditch-co.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Appellee was entitled to use of water because, absent express statute to the contrary, appellee was the first appropriator of water from the natural stream for a beneficial purpose and had the prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee claimed to be the owner of certain water by virtue of an appropriation. Appellants were the owners of lands that were naturally irrigated by the same water. A portion of appellee's dam was torn out and its diversion of water seriously interfered with by appellants. Appellee brought an action for damages arising out of the trespass and for injunctive relief to prevent repetitions in the future. The trial court found in favor of appellee. Appelants challenged the order but the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands apply to the case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The common law doctrine giving the riparian owner a right to the flow of water in its natural channel upon and over his lands, even though he makes no beneficial use thereof, is inapplicable to Colorado. Imperative necessity, unknown to the countries which gave it birth, compels the recognition of another doctrine in conflict therewith. In the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose has, with the qualifications contained in the constitution, a prior right thereto, to the extent of such appropriation.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands was inapplicable. Instead, the court applied the rule that, in the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose had a prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Beginning of Colorodo Statue relies on First Appropriation
    - Reliance on First Approriation has resulted in investment
  - First Appropriation for a beneficial purpose rule
    - Based on climate of area.
      - West = dry and requires irrigation v. East = industrial use


### Diffuse Surface Water
- Each landowner has an absolute right to use self-help to repel inflows of these waters
  - To combat the common enemy of surface water, even if it causes damaging flooding to other landowners.
- Recently modified by judicial policing for reasonableness


### Corellative Rights
- Scope of ownership corrollate to something else
  - Ownership of land corelates to the ownership of the underground water.
- Based on other allocations that are considered just
- Problems:
  - Ability to extract from underground
  - Competing landowners uses
    - Beneficial use v. non-beneficial use

#### Case: *[Higday v. Nickolaus](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Under rule of reasonable use, overlying owner such as city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from land from which it was taken if result was to impair supply of adjoining landowners to their injury.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondent city sought to extract groundwater from wells to supply its growing population. Appellant landowners, a group of farmers, filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunction, requesting a judicial declaration of their rights to percolating waters under their lands and seeking an injunction to prevent the city from infringing on those rights. The trial court dismissed the petition.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the pleaded averments of plaintiffs' petition raise in plaintiffs a property right to the reasonable use of the percolating waters underlying their lands? If so, was defendant city’s threatened use of the percolating waters an infringement of those rights as would be enjoined by equity?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Generally, a basis is made out of equity's interference by injunction to prevent the wrongful diversion of percolating waters by a pleading that establishes the plaintiff's right to the use of the water, that he has suffered or will suffer, legal injury, that the acts of the defendant are the cause of the plaintiff's injury, that the injury, present or threatened, is irreparable, and that no adequate redress can be obtained in an action at law. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the landowners' petition for declaratory relief and injunction against the city and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court held that the landowners stated a real controversy and that a declaratory judgment action was the proper method of obtaining relief in a suit to quiet title to water rights. Under the rule of reasonable use, an overlying owner such as the city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from the land from which it was taken if the result was to impair the supply of the adjoining landowners to their injury. The fundamental measure of the overlying owner's right to use groundwater was whether it was for purposes incident to the beneficial enjoyment of the land from which it was taken. The landowners' petition showed that the landowners were threatened with wrongful invasion of their water rights by the city and that the injury was irreparable</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - All underground water is assumed to be percolating
  - Rejection of first appropriation rule
  - Developes reasonable use standard for ground water
    - Reasonable = Beneficial Use on the land itself
    - Water cannot be extracted and shipped to somewhere else so long as it does not interfere with other users benficially enjoying their properties.
  - City could still use emminant domain to acquire property and water rights

## 3.0 The *Ad Coelum* Rule, Sequential Possession & *Nemo Dat*
### 3.1 The *Ad Coelum Rule*
  - "To whomever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths"
  - Cone of ownership from center of earth to outter reaches of universe
  - Applies to resources discovered beneath the surface
    - Minerals
    - Oil/Gas Deposits
    - Mines/Caves

#### Case: *[Edwards v. Sims](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-edwards-v-sims.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Petitioner property owners sought a writ of prohibition against respondent judge of the Edmonson Circuit Court (Kentucky), to prevent the judge from enforcing an order permitting the inspection of a cave on their property and punishing them for contempt for any disobedience of the order.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The property owners possessed land on which caves were situated. The judge of the lower court entered an order that surveyors were permitted to enter upon the land to survey a cave for the purpose of securing evidence on an issue as to whether or not a part of the cave was being exploited under the lands of another party. The property owners claimed that the lower court was without jurisdiction or authority to order the inspection and sought a writ of prohibition against the judge. Upon review, the court denied the writ of prohibition. The case was elevated to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can the Court permit inspection of a cave in one's property to secure evidence for a different case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> If a party is deprived of the entire use of his property, it is a taking, within the scope of the Fifth Amendment, although the mere title is not disturbed; but by an inspection neither the title nor the general use is taken, and all that can be said is that there is a temporary and limited interruption of the exclusive use.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that there was no difference in principle between the invasion of a mine on adjoining property to ascertain whether or not the minerals were being extracted from under the applicant's property and an inspection of the property owner's land through his cave to ascertain whether or not he was trespassing under another person's property. The court found that the lower court judge reviewed surveys of the surface of both parties, but the conflicting opinions were of no assistance to the judge. The judge concluded that the only viable option to ending the controversy was an accurate survey of the cave by an uninterested party.

</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    <b>Majority Opinion:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Caves = to an extent mines and a court of equity however has the inherent power, independent of statute to compel a mine owner to permit an inspection of his works with certain limits:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>The person applying for such an inspection must show a **bona fide** claim and;</li>
          <li>Allege facts showing a necessity for the inspection and examination of the adverse party's property and;</li>
          <li>The party whose property is to be inspected must have had an opportunity to be herd in relation thereto</li>
        </ol>
      <li>"We can see no difference in prcinple between the invasion of a mine on adjoining property to ascertain whether or not the minerals are being extracted from under the applicant's property and an inspection of this respondant's party..."</li>
      <li>Controversy can be quickly and accurately settled by surveying the cave.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <b>Dissenting Opinion:</b></br>
    <ol>
      <li> Trite to say that he who owns the surface of real estate, without reservation owns from the center of the earth to the outmost sentinel of the solar system. = Not true and has never been true.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The rule should be that he who owns the surface is the owner of everything that may be taken from the earth and used for his profit or happiness.</li>
        <li>Applicable to mining but not to the case at hand. "No man can bring up from the depths of the earth the Stygian darkness"</li>
        <li><b>A cave or cavern should belong absolutely to him who owns its entrance.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li>It should not be held that he owns that which he cannot use and which is of no benefit to him and which may be of benefit to others. "Shall a man be allowed to stop airplanes flying above his land because he owns the surface?"</li>
      <li><b>He owns nothing which he cannot subject to his dominion</b></li>
      <li><i>The cave was his because he had made it what it was, and without what he had done it was nothing of value.</i></li>

### 3.2 Sequential Possession
- Relativity of Title/Rejection of the *jus tertii* defense (Defense based on the rights of 3rd parties)
- **Trover**: “forced purchase” action for recovery of damages for conversion of personal property, generally measured by the property’s value
  - e.g., the chimney sweep could recover the value of the jewel, but not the jewel itself. Armory.

#### 3.2.1 Prior Possessor Prevails
- The finder’s right of ownership trumps all but the original owner’s right (or earlier finders’ rights).

#### Case: *[Armory v. Delamirie](Link)*
-Finder v. Keeper (Earlier Possessor Won)

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π a chimney sweeper's boy found a jewel and carried it to the ∆s (goldsmiths) shop to find it what it was, delivered then to the apprentice. Apprentice weighed the stones and offered 3 halfpence. Boy refused and asked for the jewel back. Apprentice delivered socket without the stones.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does π have claim over the found jewel?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>

      <ol>
        <li><b>The finder of a jewel, though he does not by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, has a such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner and consequently may maintain trover</b></li>
        <li> That the action will lay against the master, who gives credit to his apprentice, and is answerable for his neglect</li>
        <li>Unless ∆ presented the missing jewel, Jury should presume the strongest against him, and make the value of the best jewels the measure of the damages.</li>
      </ol>

    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Found in favor of the π. Appropriate measure of damages is the value of the jewel. Jewel was not presented in court as evidence, so value of jewel should be presumed the strongest against the ∆.(Information forcing rule)</li>

    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Trover: Common-law action to recover the value of personal property that has been wrongfully disposed of by another person.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
- Both parties can claim that the other is not the true owner of the jewel.
- Finder's property right good against everyone in the world, EXCEPT the true owner.
- Information forcing rule/Penalty faulting Rule
  - Information asymmetry between two parties, and that information is relevent, court provides incentive to provide information.
- "Finders keepers losers weepers" != not an accurate representation of the law.
- Finder acts as a Bailley to the true owner.
  - Finder can sue until the statute of limitaitons runs out.
  - NY State Law on Finders - 1958 hinged on price then, after inflation around $100 today.
    - If the found property is worth less than $10, if you make reasonable efforts and cannot do so, permitted to keep the property after 1 year.
    - If the found property is worth $20 or more, must be turned into police who must hold it for a specified time of up to 3 years, then the finder is entitled to keep it. Punishable by misdomenor, fine and imprisonment.
    - If value of is >10 but <20 the statutes are silent.


#### 3.2.2 Subsequent Possession
- **TO > F1 > F2. “It’s more mine than yours.”**

#### Case: *[Clark v. Maloney](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-clark-v-maloney.aspx)*
-Finder v. Finder (Earlier Possessor Won)

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Action of trover to <b>to recover the value of ten white pine logs</b> which were found by π floating in the Delaware bay after a great freshet, were afterwards taken up and moored with ropes to the mouth of a creek, and in possession of ∆ who refused to give them up alleging they had found them adrift floating up the creek. </li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff found logs floating and moored them; subsequently they were lost and came into the possession of defendants, who refused to give them to plaintiff, contending they had found them adrift, and asserting a sufficient property in the logs as to any but the original owner. Plaintiff brought an action in trover to recover the value of logs from defendant.

#### Case: *[Anderson v. Gouldberg](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-anderson-v-gouldberg.aspx)*
-Converter v. Converter (Earlier Possessor Won)

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> One who acquired possession of pine logs by trespassing upon the land of some third party had a right to retain that possession against mere wrongdoers who were strangers to the property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs harvested lumber while trespassing and took the logs to the defendants’ mill, where the defendants took them. The possessor of personal property filed action to recover the possession of 93 pine logs with damages. The possessor claimed that he cut the logs in question and hauled them to a mill from which place strangers took them. The logs in controversy were not cut upon the land of the strangers, and consequently they were entire strangers to the personal property. The trial court entered a judgment for the possessor even though it had found that the possessor had trespassed upon the land in question. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is possession of personal property sufficient title to enable the possessor to recover the property from a stranger who took the property?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Possession only raises a presumption of title. One who takes property from the possession of another can only rebut this presumption by showing a superior title in himself, or in some way connecting himself with one who has. One who acquires possession has a right against a mere wrongdoer who is a stranger to the property. Any other rule leads to an endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals in every case where property once passes out of the possession of the rightful owner. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed and found that plaintiff obtained possession of the logs in the first instance by trespassing upon the land of some third party. When it was said that to maintain replevin plaintiff's possession must have been lawful, it meant that it must have been lawful as against the person who deprived him of the property. Possession was good title against the entire world except those having a better title. Possession only raised a presumption of title. One who took property from the possession of another could only rebut the presumption by showing a superior title in himself or in some way connecting himself with one who had superior title. The court held that one who acquired the possession of property, whether by finding, bailment, or by mere tort, had a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who was a stranger to the property.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    - Replevin v. Trover
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Armory rule should apply. Finder = Converter
    - Possession title whether by finder, bailment or by mere tort has a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who was a stranger to the property.
  - Later case came to the opposite result.
    - Later converter won against prior converter.
    - Rare since wrongdoers typically do not present themselves in court.

#### Jus Tertii Defense (Not applicable) - Right of the Third Person
- A suit for possession of personal property cannot be defeated by showing that someone else has a better claim.
  - A v. B cannot claim that C has better claim than both
- Rejected by courts as a defense.
  - Common law involves only the 2 parties of the case and no Jus Tertii Defense
    - Jury may lack information on a party not involved in the case
    - Jury cannot make a ruling on information not available


### 3.3 *Nemo Dat*
- *"One cannot give that which one does not have"*
  - You cannot buy the Brooklyn Bridge
- *"Prior in time is prior in right"*
- Property rights are always exclusive
  - Two persons cannot hold the same property right at the same time.
- Current owners must be able to trace their ownership back in time through a series of legitimate transfers (ideally) to an act of legitimate original acquisition.
- Generic name for land (Black Acre)

### 3.4 Adverse Possession

- "Squatters Rights"
  - Ordinarily a tort - Trespass
- Adverse Possessor's right is good against all including the owner so long as Adverse Possession Doctrine is fulfilled.
  - Example: A is the true owner. Adverse possession happens when B becomes the possessor without A’s consent. B might be the owner or have other rights (e.g., easement).
- Applications to both real and personal property
- **Elements** to Adverse Possession
- For possession to be adverse, it must be (1) under claim of ownership; (2) actual or hostile; (3) open, notorious, and visible; (4) continuous and uninterrupted for a period of 10 years; (5) exclusive; and (6) peaceful. The claimant must prove each element by clear and convincing evidence. - *Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.*
  1. **Actual Claim of Ownership**.
    - Actual Entry giving exclusive possession
    - Triggers Statute of Limitations
    - Stakes out property to be claimed
      - Must fly his flag over the property in such a way as to put the actual owner on notice that the property is being held under an adverse claim of ownership.
        - Quality of acts not Quantity
  2. **Exclusive**
    - Possessor evinces an intention to possess and hold land to the exclusion of and in opposition to, the claims of all others and conduct must indicate that he is exercising the dominion of a sole owner.
  3. **Open & Notorious & Visible Possession**
    - Penalizes owner for sleeping on their rights
      - Test is objective
      - *Scott v. Anderson-Tully*
    - Possessor must unfurl his flag on the land and keep it flying so that the actual owner may see, and if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains, and planted the standard of conquest. - *Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.*
  4. **Possession that is continuous for the statutory period**
    - Need not be constant just match average owner's use
  5. **Hostile Possession that is Adverse**
    - Possession is hostile and adverse when the adverse possessor intends to claim title notwithstanding that the claim is made under a mistaken belief that the land is within the class of possessor's deed.
    - Under a claim of right (color of title)
      - Some piece of paper that makes you think you have a right to the property even if mistaken.
  6. **For the Statutory Time**
    - Exceptions for disabilities
  7. Optional
    - **Peaceful** (Non-Standard)
    - Sometimes payment of property taxes (Non-Standard)

#### Justification of Adverse Possession
  - . . . the doctrine apparently affords an anomalous instance of maturing a wrong into a right . . .
  - It’s not about the merit of the possessor, but the demerit of the one out of possession. We want people to use land in a useful way.
  - The purpose of adverse possession is to “automatically quiet all titles which are openly and consistently asserted, to provide proof of meritorious titles, and correct errors in conveyancing.
- **Economics:** Holmes was invoking diminishing marginal utility of income.
- **Psychology:** Holmes was anticipating prospect theory, which holds that people are more upset by losing something in hand than by forgoing the opportunity to realize an equivalent gain.
- **Morality:** the new possessor depends on the property, and it’s wrong for the original owner to establish and then cut off that dependence.
- **Environmental:** Assumption that land should be developed when perhaps for environmental purposes land should be left to its own devices.


#### Case: *[Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-scott-v-anderson-tully-co.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Substantial evidence in the record supported the chancellor's finding that an adjacent landowner proved adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence where it openly and notoriously possessed the disputed 20-acre tract, marked the perceived property line, and managed and harvested timber from the property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π filed suit seeking damages after ∆ removed timber from a 21 acre parcel of land that π claimed to own. Scott inhereted 1/2 interest in 584.5 acre tract of land. ∆ alleges that adjacent landowner to the east, ∆ was trespassing on a portion of the estate. ∆ argued that it acquired title to the property by adverse possession through its possession and use of the land from 1969 to 2010.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether ∆ had acquired the disputed 20 acres of land through adverse possession.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> For adverse possession it must be 1. under claim of ownership; 2. actual or hostile; 3 open notorious. and visible; 4. continuous and uninterrupted for a period of 10 years; 5. exclusive, and 6. peaceful</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> ∆ demonstrated claim of ownership by marking its borders with recognizable company blue paint. Widely known to local population. Cleared land and timber and issued 5 hunting licenses for the property. π argues ∆ did not actually or hostilely possess the property because it did not care for or improve the land on a regular basis. Generally required for adverse possession, but possessory acts necessary to establish a claim of adverse possession may vary with the characteristis of the land. If wild or unimproved land, may be established by evidence of acts that would be wholly insufficient in the case of improved or developed lands. Public acts of ownership sufficient. The Court held that substantial evidence in the record supported the courts finding that the company, an adjacent landowner, proved adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence where it openly and notoriously possessed the disputed 20-acre tract from 1969 until the purported owner's complaint was filed in 2010, the adjacent landowner marked its perceived boundary line with blue paint when it purchased the property in 1969 and repainted the boundary line in 1986 and 1998, the adjacent landowner managed timber uninterruptedly from 1969 to 2010 and harvested timber in 1990, 1999, and 2010, and no testimony was presented that the purported owner or anyone else used the disputed property after 1969.
     </li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - π asserts claim because he began paying property taxes on the disputed tract in 1993
    - No evidence to support claim by π.
    - Payment of taxes alone is not dispostive of the claim of ownership
  - Proof of adverse possession of wild land is measurably lower than had the property been developed.

#### Claim of Right
- The adverse possession doctrine has no application to one who actually knows that he has no claim or title or right to a title.
  - Main purpose is to bar mere squatters from the benefits of adverse possession.
  - Three Positions
    1. Adverse under a claim of right means that the AP **subjectively (but mistakenly)** believes he is legally entitled to possession of the property. **(The AP is acting in good faith)**
      - *Carptenter v. Ruperto*
    2. Adverse under a claim of right means that the AP subjectively believes he is not legally entitled to possession of the property. (The AP is acting in bad faith) (Main Rule) = (No Jurisdiction follows this rule)
    3. The AP's subjective state of mind is irrelevant; all that matters is that the AP has not been given permission by the TO to use the property. (Conneticut Rule)

#### Color of Title
- Evidence (like a written deed) that appears to establish title but actually does not
  - (e.g., because the original seller lacked a valid title, or because the seller was not competent to transfer the property).
  - Some jurisdictions require color of title others do not
  - Gives AP advantages
    - AP of partial black acre **with a color of title** could have claim to **whole black acre**
      - (NY Follows Advantage)
      - Requires following of custom to determine if activity = encolsure, improvement, possession.

#### Problems with Adverse Possesson & Disability
- Disabilities: some disabilities render property owners incompetent to transfer ownership of their property, e.g., dementia.
  - A disability is immaterial unless it existed at the time when the cause of action accrued (i.e., when the adverse possessor first. took possession of the land).
  - Traditionally, the three Is: infancy, insanity, imprisonment.
    - O owns the property in 1984. A enters adversely on May 1, 1984. The age of majority is 18. The statutory period is 21 years, unless the owner is disabled, in which case the AP must still reach the 21-year period and can then gain ownership ten years after the removal of the disability.

#### Boundry Disputes
- **Doctrine of agreed boundaries**: if the boundary is uncertain, an oral agreement between neighbors is enforceable if they accept the line for a long time.
- **Doctrine of acquiescence**: long acquiescence is evidence of an agree- ment fixing the boundary line


#### Adverse Possession Against the Government
- Adverse possession does not apply to the government
  - Very high monitoring costs that would be involved to ensure to adverse possession.
- The doctrine has been retained in some states, modified in others with a longer statute of limitations against the government than against private owners and has been abololished in others.


#### Case: *[Carpenter v. Ruperto](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-carpenter-v-ruperto.aspx)*
- Outlier of Adverse Possession.
  - Rarely explicitly stated that AP requires good faith under claim of right.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The property owner knew she had no legal right to possession of the disputed land; therefore, she could not establish a good faith claim of right, and the trial court properly found against her in her action to quiet title to the piece of property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The property, which plaintiff claimed to have acquired by adverse possession was the south 60 feet of defendants' lot. She claimed open, exclusive, hostile, adverse, and actual possession under a claim of right. She installed a propane tank on the parcel and used part of it as a driveway. The trial court held in part that she did not establish her possession was under a claim of right. However, it ordered defendants to "do equity" by deeding to her the strip of land her driveway was on and to pay the costs of moving the propane tank to her lot. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the appeal and dismissed the cross-appeal. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did plaintiff fail to prove a good faith claim of right?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> One claiming title by adverse possession must establish hostile, actual, open, exclusive and continuous possession, under a claim of right or color of title, for at least ten years, by clear and positive proof. Because the law presumes possession under regular title, the doctrine is strictly construed. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that good faith was essential to adverse possession under a claim of right. Plaintiff failed to prove a good faith claim of right. She knew her lot did not include the cornfield north of it. At the time she entered possession of the disputed land, plaintiff knew she had no legal right to do so. Possession for the statutory period could not be bootstrapped into a basis for claiming a right to possession. Defendants' cross-appeal was untimely and compliance with he time limitations for taking a cross-appeal was mandatory and jurisdictional.</li>

#### Case: *[Howard v. Kunto](Link)*
- Demonstrates the court's ability to clean up property issues through adverse possession.
- First, tacking is allowed for two adverse possessors in privity with each other. Second, seasonal use satisfies the requirements for adverse possession if the ordinary use of the property is seasonal.
- Tacking = Joining consecutive periods of possession by multiple people as a single period of possession.
  - Generally, tacking is allowed if successive possessors are in privity. The reason is that squatters should not be able to profit from tres- passing.66 But in this case, because all occupants acted in good faith on an erroneous deed, privity should not be required. Tacking is allowed here.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Ten year summer occupancy and continued improvements to land sufficient to constitute defendants' continuity of possession for purposes of tacking and establishing right to title based on adverse possession.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendants' house stood on one lot while their deed described the adjacent lot. At the time quiet title action was commenced, defendants occupied the disputed property less than a year. The lower court found defendants unable to establish a claim for adverse possession because they failed to prove continuity of possession to permit tacking of defendants' possession to their predecessors'. The court concluded that a ten year summer occupancy did not destroy continuity of possession for purposes of adverse possession because the land was regularly used during the time it was capable of use and defendants made continued improvements on the land. As a result, the court found tacking permitted. The court determined the privity requirement for tacking was satisfied because defendants' claim of right as the last of successive purchasers who received title under the mistaken belief they acquired a contiguous track was sufficiently above that of a trespasser.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>Reject the conclusion that the summer occupancy only of a summer beach home destroys the continuity of possession required by statute. It is not necessary that the occupant should be actually upon the premises continually. If the land is occuped during the period of time during the year it is capable of use, there is sufficient continuity. Furhter, adverse possession is permitted if the successive occupants are in privity. Held that sufficient privity of state to permit tacking and thus establish adverse possession as a matter of law.</li>

  Lot Occupant|  -   | Kuntos   | Moyers   | Howards

- **Continuous != Continual**
  - Continuous = Without Interuption
  - Continual = Happens Repeatedly
- The court rejects the conclusion that summer occupancy only of a summer beach home destroys the continuity of possession required by Wash. Rev. Code § 4.16.020
- Continuity of possession may be established although the land is used regularly for only a certain period each year.
- The rule which permits tacking is one of substance and not of absolute mathematical continuity, provided there is no break so as to sever two possessions. It is not necessary that the occupant should be actually upon the premises continually. If the land is occupied during the period of time during the year it is capable of use, there is sufficient continuity.
- A purchaser may tack the adverse use of its predecessor in interest to that of his own where the land was intended to be included in the deed between them, but was mistakenly omitted from the description.
- Tacking of adverse possession is permitted if the successive occupants are in "privity."
- What about Howard? Is he left without property?

#### Case: *[Moore v. Regents of the University of California](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Physician's use of patient's cells in medical research without the patient's permission did not state a cause of action for conversion because the patient had no ownership interest in the cells after they left his body.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Review was sought of appellate court's decision, which found plaintiff stated cause of action for conversion when defendants used plaintiff's cells in medical research without permission. The court found plaintiff stated cause of action for breach of physician's disclosure obligations. Physicians seeking patient consent for medical procedures must disclose personal interests unrelated to the patient's health that may affect medical judgment. Defendant did not properly disclose personal interests in plaintiff's cells before he operated, thus plaintiff stated cause of action for breach of disclosure obligations. The court reversed and held use of plaintiff's cells without permission did not state conversion cause of action. Plaintiff did not retain ownership interest in cells after they left his body and thus could not assert conversion claim. Conversion should not lie because it would discourage medical research of cells and patients are adequately protected from abuse because of informed consent laws.
 </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does existing law give right to the spleen? Should existing law be extended to give π right to the spleend? </li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To establish a conversion, plaintiff must establish an actual interference with his ownership or right of possession. Where plaintiff neither has title to the property alleged to have been converted, nor possession thereof, he cannot maintain an action for conversion. While it ordinarily suffices to allege ownership generally, it is well established that a complaint's contentions or conclusions of law do not bind courts. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, Cal. Health and Safety Code § 7150 et seq., permits a competent adult to give all or part of his body for certain designated purposes, including transplantation, therapy, medical or dental education, research, or advancement of medical or dental science. The act does not, however, permit the donor to receive valuable consideration for the transfer.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the appellate court's decision, finding plaintiff did not state conversion claim when defendants used plaintiff's cells in medical research without permission because plaintiff had no ownership interest in cells after they left his body; plaintiff did state claim for breach of physician's disclosure obligations.</li>

### Trespass to Land
- Central Right of Property Ownership = The Right to Exclude Others

#### Case: *[Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Punitive damage award of $ 100,000, which was given to property owners for intentional trespass to land, was sustained although the jury awarded $ 1.00 in nominal damages.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant’s mobile home was delivered by passing through the land owned by his neighbor despite the latter’s refusal to allow such passage. Plaintiff filed an action for trespass and was awarded nominal and punitive damages. Defendant opposed the award of punitive damages due to prior jurisprudence ruling otherwise. Punitive damages may be awarded in the discretion of the jury. Because the property owners' legal right to exclude all others from their land was involved, the court noted that the law recognized that actual harm occurred in every trespass. In the case of intentional trespass to land, the nominal damage award represented the recognition that actual harm had occurred. The decision, which carved an exception to precedent, applied to the trespasser as a reward to the property owners who persevered in attacking an unsound rule. The court also held that the amount of punitive damages was not excessive because the trespasser's conduct was egregious and deceitful.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether an award of nominal damages for intentional tresspass to land may support a punitive damage award for intentional trespass?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To determine whether, as a matter of law, the question of punitive damages should have been submitted to the jury, the reviewing court reviews the record de novo.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The award of punitive damages is subject to the jury’s discretion and should not rely entirely on judicial precedent. Furthermore, the facts of each case involving claims for such damages should be reviewed de novo. Society has an interest in punishing and deterring intentional trespassers beyond that of protecting the interests of the individual landowner. Society has an interest in preserving the integrity of the legal system. Private landowners should feel confident that wrongdoers who trespass upon their land will be appropriately punished. The fact that the actor knows that his entry is without the consent of the possessor and without any other privilege to do so, while not necessary to make him liable, may affect the amount of damages recoverable against him, by showing such a complete disregard of the possessor's legally protected interest in the exclusive possession of his land as to justify the imposition of punitive in addition to nominal damages for even a harmless trespass, or in addition to compensatory damages for one which is harmful.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - The actual harm is not the damage done to the land, which may be minimal, but in the loss of the individual's right to exclude others from his or her property and the court impled that this right may be punished by a large damage award despite the lack of measurable harm.
    - Essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.

#### Case: *[Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>The landowner filed suit against the airlines seeking injunctive relief and damages for alleged trespasses of airline flights over his land. The court affirmed the district court's dismissal of the landowner's bills. The court held that the landowner did not allege an injury by trespass that was legally sufficient. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does traversing the airspace above appellants' land considered trespassing?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> We own so much of the space above the ground as we can occupy or make use of, in connection with the enjoyment of our land. This right is not fixed. It varies with our varying needs and is coextensive with them. The owner of land owns as much of the space above him or her as is used, but only so long as he or she uses it. All that lies beyond belongs to the world.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The case differs from the usual case of enjoining a trespass. Ordinarily, if a trespass is committed upon land, the plaintiff is entitled to at least nominal damages without proving or alleging any actual damage. In the instant case, traversing the airspace above appellants' land is not, of itself, a trespass at all, but it is a lawful act unless it is done under circumstances which will cause injury to appellants' possession. Appellants do not, therefore, in their bill state a case of trespass, unless they allege a case of actual and substantial damage. The bill fails to do this. It merely draws a naked conclusion as to damages without facts or circumstances to support it. It follows that the complaint does not state a case for injunctive relief.</li>

### Repeated Trespasses

#### Case: *[Baker v. Howard County Hunt](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Dismissal of a trespass complaint against fox hunters for damages their hounds had caused was improper. An injunction was a proper remedy when there were repeated actions, the destruction of property, and irreparable injury.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant fox hunters repeatedly crossed the plaintiff landowners' property with their hounds while in pursuit of a fox. The hounds killed and harassed the plaintiffs' livestock and disrupted experiments that he was conducting. Plaintiff brought a trespass to land action and sought an injunction. The trial court dismissed the complaint and on appeal, the court reversed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Were plaintiffs entitled to injunctive relief?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Equity will relieve against continuing or repeated trespasses, committed in pursuance of a single plan or purpose. Although an injunction will not be granted to restrain a trespasser merely because he is a trespasser, equity will interfere where the injury is irreparable or where full and adequate relief cannot be granted at law, or where the trespass goes to the destruction of the property as it had been held and enjoyed, or to prevent multiplicity of suits. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that the rights of the fox hunters were subordinate to the rights of the landowners, and that, if a hunter went on the lands of another against the owner's will, he was a trespasser. Similarly, the fox hunters were liable for the actions of the hounds when the evidence showed that they knew of the dogs' actions. An injunction was a proper remedy to avoid a multiplicity of actions, where the injury was irreparable or the trespass destroyed property. An injunction was appropriate against the fox hunters.</li>

### Building Encroachments

#### Case: *[Pile v. Pedrick](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> It was proper to require an encroacher to remove a foundation wall that extended into a neighbor's property by one and three-eighths inches for a length of 50 feet because the encroacher was trespassing on the neighbor's property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The encroacher's foundation wall extended over the neighbor's property by one and three-eight's inches for a length of fifty feet. The encroacher contended that it should be permitted to enter the neighbor's land to remove the wall. The neighbor objected to paying one half of the costs. The court affirmed the judgment and permitted the encroacher one year to remove the wall. The court held that the encroacher had no choice but to remove the wall as ordered because the encroacher was trespassing on the neighbor's property. The court also affirmed the allocation of costs because it was within the trial court's discretion to allocate the costs.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the encroachment considered a party wall?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> There is at common law no right to build a party wall over a neighbor's land: Barlow v. Norman, 2 W. Bl. 959; Bloch v. Isham, 7 Am. Law. Reg., N.S. 10; Weston v. Arnold, L.R. 8 Chan. App. 1084.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that the wall in controversy was not a party wall. It was not intended to be. The defendants were building a factory and under the advice of their architect decided to build within their own lines in order to avoid the danger of injury to others from vibration which might result from the use of their machinery. They called upon the district surveyor to locate their line and built within it as so ascertained. Subsequent surveys by city surveyors have determined that the line was not accurately located at first but was about one and a half inches over on the plaintiffs' property. This leaves the ends of the stones used in the foundation wall projecting into the plaintiffs' lands below the surface one and three eighths inches. This unintentional intrusion into the plaintiffs' land is the narrow foundation on which this bill in equity rests. </li>

#### Case: *[Golden Press Inc. v. Rylands](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A mandatory injunction requiring removal of a building should have been denied where the surveying error, if any, was not in bad faith, only the underground footings of the building were encroaching, and there was no impact on the subject property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs' action sought an injunction and damages for the encroachment of defendant's building onto their property. The jury returned a verdict for defendant, but the court set aside the verdict, entered a mandatory injunction in favor of plaintiffs, and ordered a new trial on damages. Defendant appealed and the court reversed the injunction, but permitted plaintiffs to proceed with an action for damages. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the denial of the mandatory injunction on the removal of a building encroachment valid?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Where an encroachment of a building was deliberate and constituted a willful and intentional taking of another's land, equity may well require its restoration regardless of the expense of removal as compared with damage suffered therefrom; but where the encroachment was in good faith, the court should weigh the circumstances so that it shall not act oppressively. While the mere balance of convenience is not the proper test, relative hardship may properly be considered and the court should not become a party to extortion. Where defendant's encroachment is unintentional and slight, and plaintiff's use was not affected, mandatory injunction may be denied when the damage is small and the cost of removal would cause grave hardship.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> It was conceded that only the footings of the building encroached and that encroachment was only a few inches. There was a conflict concerning the survey and the location of the footings, but the court held that the encroachment was not done in bad faith. The court noted that there was no impact on plaintiffs' present use of their property. The only potential impact would be if plaintiffs also decided to build on the property line, and even then the impact would be minimal. The encroachment was very slight, but the remedial cost would be high. The court also reversed the portion of the injunction requiring defendant to remove signs that may have mislead visitors and caused them to trespass on plaintiffs' property. That portion of the injunction was too indefinite.</li>

### Mistaken Improver

#### Case: *[Producers Lumber & Supply Co. v. Olney Building Co.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>  A company that had erroneously constructed a building on another's lot was required to pay the lot owner the value of the building after the company demolished the building without the knowledge or consent of the lot owner.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee erroneously constructed a building on a lot owned by appellant. Appellee subsequently demolished the building. Appellant instituted an action against appellee to recover damages therefore. A jury in the court below found that appellee had acted maliciously in demolishing the building because it did so without the consent or knowledge of appellant. Finally, the jury found that appellant was entitled to receive $ 300 in exemplary damages. The parties stipulated that the building had a value of $ 5,000 and that the building had enhanced the value of the lot by $ 5,000. The court below awarded appellant $ 600, which was the amount the jury found it would cost to restore the lot to the same condition it was in immediately before the construction commenced. On appeal, the court amended the lower court's judgment to permit appellant to recover the sums of $ 5,000 and $ 300 in addition to the $ 600 awarded by the court below.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is an improver authorized to go upon the land of another, without his knowledge and consent, and demolish the improvements that he has through mistake placed thereon?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> It is only where a person places permanent improvements upon land belonging to another in a good faith belief that he is the owner of the land, that he has any remedy at all. Where he has built such improvements in good faith, he has a somewhat limited right to go into court, and upon proof of such good faith ask the court to grant him equitable relief. Under such circumstances, a court of equity may grant relief in several ways. If the building can be removed without great injury to the building or to the land, the court may permit the improver to move the building. Where the building cannot well be removed the court or jury can find the market value of the land before and after the making of the improvement, and allow the improver to recover for the amount of this enhanced value, if any. The landowner will first be permitted to pay the enhanced value and keep the land, but if he is unable or unwilling to do so, then the improver may be permitted to pay the value of the land before the improvements were placed thereon, and thus become the owner of the land and the improvements.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court found that appellant was entitled to the value of the building because appellee committed waste when it demolished the building without the knowledge or consent of appellant. The lower court's judgment was affirmed as amended.</li>

#### Case: *[Berg v. Wiley](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The court held that a plaintiff tenant was entitled to damages for wrongful eviction where the defendant landlord locked the plaintiff out of leased premises when plaintiff had been cited for health code violations.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A restaurant had been cited for health code violations. The owner of the restaurant failed to comply with his landlord’s request to remedy the matters and put up a sign saying the restaurant was closed. As a result, the landlord locked the his tenant out, claiming breach of the lease. The jury found that the tenant did not abandon or surrender the premises and the trial court found landlord's reentry forcible and wrongful as a matter of law. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the landlord commit forcible entry?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The forcible entry and unlawful detainer statutes are intended to prevent parties from taking the law into their own hands during the eviction process. To further discourage self-help, the legislature has provided treble damages for forcible evictions, Minn. Stat. §§ 557.08 and 557.09, and has provided additional criminal penalties for intentional and unlawful exclusion of a tenant. Minn. Stat. § 504.25.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court held the modern rule is that judicial proceedings, including the summary procedures provided in unlawful detainer statutes, are the exclusive remedy by which a landlord may remove a tenant claiming possession. A landlord's reentry in the tenant's absence by picking the locks and locking the tenant out, although accomplished without actual violence, is forcible as a matter of law. Furthermore, Minnesota has historically followed the common-law rule that a landlord may rightfully use self-help to retake leased premises from a tenant in possession without incurring liability for wrongful eviction provided two conditions are met: (1) The landlord is legally entitled to possession, such as where a tenant holds over after the lease term or where a tenant breaches a lease containing a reentry clause; and (2) the landlord's means of reentry are peaceable. Under the common-law rule, a tenant who is evicted by his landlord may recover damages for wrongful eviction where the landlord either had no right to possession or where the means used to remove the tenant were forcible, or both.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>

  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - The common law rule allowed the landlord to resort to self-help in reentering, but he risked criminal penalties for forcible entry.
  - One criticism of the trend away from allowing self-help is that landlord will pass the costs of litigating against deadbeat tenants on to tenants who pay their bills on time.
  - Should self-help be allowed for commercial but not residential leases? Should the parties be allowed to negotiate in the lease whether self-help is available?
  - Does self-help violate due process?
- Risk of Violence = not peaceful/peacable
- Should self-help be allowed for commercial but not residential leases? Should the parties be allowed to negotiate in the lease whether self-help is available?

### Exceptions to the Right to Exclude
#### Necessity
#### Case: *[Ploof v. Putnam](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> In an action for damages resulting from the unmooring of plaintiff's sloop from defendant's dock, plaintiff's declaration was sufficient to implicate that defendant's servant was acting within the scope of his employment.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant was the owner of a dock attached to an island. Plaintiff was sailing in a loaded sloop with his wife and children. A storm arose and plaintiff moored the sloop to defendant's dock to avoid danger to their lives and to their property. Defendant's servant unmoored the sloop, and the sloop was driven upon the shore by the storm and destroyed. Plaintiff sued defendant alleging that defendant by his servant negligently unmoored the sloop. Defendant demurred to both counts, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's general demurrers.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Were the plaintiff’s actions reasonably necessary to save the lives of the sloop’s occupants?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The doctrine of necessity applies with special force to the preservation of human life. One assaulted and in peril of his life may run through the close of another to escape from his assailant. One may sacrifice the personal property of another to save his life or the lives of his fellows.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The allegations are, in substance, that the stress of a sudden and violent tempest compelled the plaintiff to moor to defendant's dock to save his sloop and the people in it. The condition of necessity is complete, for it covers not only the necessity of mooring, but the necessity of mooring to the dock.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendants did not trespass on farmer's property to provide governmental and charitable services to migrant farmworker because traditional state law property principles did not give right to deny migrant workers access to the services.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendants, an attorney and health service worker, entered on private property to aid a migrant farmworker housed there. The owner-employer said he would allow defendants to meet with the migrant workers they sought, but only in his presence in his office.

## Abandonment & Transfer
#### Gift Causa Mortis
#### Case: *[Foster v. Reiss](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendant was not entitled to items by a valid gift causa mortis even though his wife's donative intent was clear in letter because there was no delivery of the items sufficient to divest her of complete dominion and control.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendant, the deceased's husband, claimed he was entitled to cash, a savings account, and a building and loan book through a gift causa mortis by his wife. The deceased had written a note which indicated her intent for him to have these items and told him where they could be found in their home. Plaintiff trustees of the estate objected, claiming a valid gift causa mortis had not taken place. Plaintiffs appealed the judgment in defendant's favor in the latter's action to recover items taken.  The court reversed the judgment which awarded items to defendant because there was no valid gift causa mortis when no delivery of the items had taken place.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was there a valid gift causa mortis?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To constitute a valid gift causa mortis, the gift must be made in view of the donor's impending death, the donor must die of the disorder or peril and there must be a delivery of the thing given. The donor must be competent to make the gift. There must be an intent upon his part to do so and an acceptance by the donee. The delivery must be such as is actual, unequivocal, and complete during the lifetime of the donor, wholly divesting him of the possession, dominion, and control thereof. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court found that gifts causa mortis are not favored. The court determined a gift causa mortis required donative intent, which the letter indicated, and delivery. The court found the two requirements are separate and distinct and the informal letter did not constitute both. The court found no delivery of the intended gifts sufficient to constitute complete divesting of the deceased's control. The court determined there was no affirmative action on the deceased's part to satisfy the delivery requirement. An informal writing does not satisfy the separate and distinct requirement of delivery, but rather there must be such delivery of the property that the donor stands absolutely deprived of his control over it. </li>

The jury held for the Defendant.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Wood bought a ticket to attend horse races that were schedule to take place on property owned by Lord Eglintoun. With the ticket,Plaintiff would be permitted to enter Eglintoun’s property and stay there while the races took place. For reasons that are unknown, Eglintoun decided to remove Plaintiff from the property while one of the races were taking place. Lead bitter, Eglintoun’s servant, forcibly removed Plaintiff from the property. Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant alleging assault and false imprisonment. Thereafter, the trial court instructed the jury that Eglintoun was authorized to remove Plaintiff from his property, regardless of Eglintoun’s reason. Also, the trial court instructed the jury that Eglintoun did not have a duty to reimburse Plaintiff with the money Plaintiff paid for the ticket.Plaintiff alleged that his ticket granted him an irrevocable license to remain on Eglintoun’s property while the races took place. The jury held for Defendant.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether a license to enter the land is revocable, unless there is a grant that permits a license holder to remove property from the land.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Unless there is a grant that permits a license holder to remove property from the land, a license to enter the land is revocable. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Unless there is a grant that permits a license holder to remove property from the land, a license to enter the land is revocable. Here, Plaintiff’s right to enter Eglintoun’s land is contingent on the type of right Plaintiff has to the land. Licenses are deemed to be revocable because licenses do not transfer a property right, but merely authorize the licensee to lawfully be present on the land. However, a grant is deemed irrevocable because grants authorize an individual to carry property away from land. Moreover, a license is revocable irrespective of whether the license is orally given, in writing, or combined with a “pretended grant” that has not been granted by deed. However, a license joined with a grant becomes irrevocable. Specifically, a written or verbal license to hunt is revocable because it particularly permits the act of hunting. Nonetheless, a license to hunt or remove away deer from property is irrevocable because it authorizes the license holder with a grant to remove deer, property, from the property. Lastly, even if one pays for a license does not automatically create an irrevocable license. Therefore, the trial court properly instructed the jury. </li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> When the recipient of a securities bond received a bond by mistake, giving the bond to the deliverer's purported messenger, an impostor, subjected the recipient to liability for conversion because it had a duty to return it to the proper owner.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Cowen and Pressprich are stockbrokers. Cowen’s agent brings abearer bond to Pressprich’s office, and drops it through a letter slot in adoor. Pressprich’s clerk picks it up, sees it is the wrong bond, opens the door,and calls for Cowen’s agent. X, who is not Cowen’s agent, responds promptlyand the clerk, not knowing Cowen’s agent, hands the faker the bond. As aninvoluntary bailee, Pressprich can be liable only if negligence is shown.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the recipient, an involuntary bailee, owe the same duty of care as a voluntary bailee, such that he had a duty to return the goods to the right person?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The involuntary bailee, as long as his lack of volition continues, is not under the slightest duty to care for or guard the subject of the bailment, and cannot be held, in respect of custody, for what would even be the grossest negligence in the case of a voluntary bailment, but in case the involuntary bailee shall exercise any dominion over the thing so bailed, he becomes as responsible as if he were a voluntary bailee.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that an involuntary bailee that exercised dominion over an item owed the same duty of care as a voluntary bailee, to deliver the bailed article to the right person. The delivery of an item in mistake for one that was ordered, the fact that the recipient could not see the messenger when the bond was delivered, and the relative ease with which the recipient could have called the deliverer or had its own messenger return the bond to the deliverer itself, gave rise to a duty on the part of the recipient to deliver the bond to its proper owner. </li>

#### Case: *[Baseball Publishing Co. v. Bruton](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Agreement between advertiser and building owner was not a license but was an easement even though it was not under seal because equity created the easement where the agreement was agreed upon for consideration.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff was engaged in the business of controlling locations for billboards and signs and contracting with advertisers for the exhibition of their placards and posters. Defendant gave plaintiff a writing signed but not sealed by defendant whereby for consideration defendant agreed to give plaintiff the exclusive right to maintain a sign on a building owned by defendant. It was provided that all signs placed on the premises remained the personal property of plaintiff. The writing was headed as a lease. Plaintiff accepted by sending defendant a check in the amount of the agreed consideration. Defendant returned the check. Plaintiff erected the contemplated sign. Defendant caused the sign to be removed. Plaintiff brought a bill for specific performance, contending the writing was a lease. The trial judge entered a final decree for specific performance for plaintiff. The supreme judicial court affirmed holding an easement in equity was created.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the right given to plaintiff a mere license?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> A license merely excuses acts done by one on land in possession of another that without the license would be trespasses, conveys no interest in land, and may be contracted for or given orally.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The trial court did not err in awarding specific performance even though the agreement was not under seal because equity created an easement on the part of plaintiff. The writing in the present case, however, seems to us to go beyond a mere license. It purports to give "the exclusive right and privilege to maintain" a certain sign on the defendant's wall. So far as the law permits, it should be so construed as to vest in the plaintiff the the right which it purports to give.</li>

#### Creation of Easements

#### Case: *[Schwab v. Timmons](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Petitioner landowners were not entitled to easement by implication or necessity; the private road petitioners sought to extend had never extended to petitioners' parcels and petitioners' grantor had not severed a landlocked portion of property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Petitioner landowners brought a declaratory judgment action against respondent landowners for a determination that petitioners were entitled to an easement by necessity or implication so that they could gain access to their landlocked property. The circuit court denied the petition on the basis that the circumstances did not fit the typical situation from which ways of necessity were implied and that even if they did, the easement would not have survived because it was not recorded. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the state supreme court affirmed, holding that petitioners failed to establish an easement by implication because the private road petitioners sought to extend did not and had never extended to petitioners' properties. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the court err in denying petitioners claim of easement by implication or by necessity over the respondents' properties?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> An easement is a liberty, privilege, or advantage in lands, without profit, and existing distinct from the ownership of the land. With an easement, there are two distinct property interests-the dominant estate, which enjoys the privileges granted by an easement, and the servient estate that permits the exercise of those privileges. An easement can be used only in connection with the real estate to which it belongs.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The petitioners failed to establish a claim for an easement by implication.  While a landlocked parcel may satisfy the necessity element, it is apparent from the amended complaint that the private road the petitioners seek to extend does not and has never extended to the petitioners' properties. They failed to allege that any use by the United States was so obvious, manifest or continuous as to show that it was meant to be permanent.
    Reasoning: Easement by necessity requirements: 1. There must have originally been 1 common owner of all the plots; - True here; used to all be owned by US government. 2. That owner must have chopped off into different parcels; AND,- True here; it was chopped into different parcels.3. The parcel is landlocked. - False here! Though the parcel was landlocked today, it was not landlocked when the common owner originally chopped it off! </li>

#### Negative Easements

#### Case: *[Fontainebleau Hotel v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five Inc](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The court could not enjoin the construction of a high-rise hotel at the request of a neighboring hotel owner, who claimed that the structure cast a shadow over its swimming pool, because there was no legal right to the free flow of light and air.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The Fontaine bleu Hotel wanted to construct an addition that would have blocked sunlight from the Eden Roc’s pool. Eden Roc sought an injunction, alleging that the addition would interfere with an implied easement protecting its light and air. A hotel corporation brought a suit to enjoin another hotel corporation from continuing with the construction of a 14-story addition to one of its hotels. It claimed that the addition cast a shadow over the cabana, swimming pool, and sunbathing areas of its own hotel. The trial court granted a temporary injunction, holding that no one had the right to use his property to the injury of another. The case was elevated to the District Court of Appeal of Florida.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The scope of an easement depends mainly on the parties’ intent. It can also depend on the circumstances surrounding the creation of the easement, whether the easement is express/implied/prescriptive, and the purpose of the easement. At common law, the landowner had no legal right, in the absence of an easement or uninterrupted use and enjoyment for a period of 20 years, to unobstructed light and air from the adjoining land. The English doctrine of "ancient lights" has been unanimously repudiated in the United States. There being, then, no legal right to the free flow of light and air from the adjoining land, it is universally held that where a structure serves a useful and beneficial purpose, it does not give rise to a cause of action, either for damages or for an injunction under the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, even though it causes injury to another by cutting off the light and air and interfering with the view that would otherwise be available over adjoining land in its natural state, regardless of the fact that the structure may have been erected partly for spite.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that there is no precedent for finding an easement for light and air. Eden Roc had no cause of action. The court found that hotel corporation seeking injunction failed to establish a cause of action. The court held that the trial court erred in applying the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. The court explained that the maxim meant only that one had to use his property so as not to injure the lawful rights of another. The court said that because there was no legal right to the free flow of light and air, the hotel undergoing construction did not use their property to injure the hotel corporation's lawful rights.</li>

#### Termination of Easement by Misuse
#### Case: *[Penn Bowling Recreation Center Inc. v. Hot Shoppes Inc.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Neither the misuse of an easement right, nor the use of an easement right beyond that which was intended when the easement was granted, constituted evidence of a forfeiture or abandonment of the easement.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The dominant tenement owner acquired property, which enjoyed an easement over the servient tenement owner's adjoining property. The servient tenement owner argued that the dominant tenement owner forfeited its easement by exceeding the rights associated with the easement. Specifically, the servient tenement owner argued that the dominant tenement owner exceeded the scope of the easement when it used the easement to service adjoining land that was not covered by the easement. The dominant tenement owner sought action to enjoin the servient tenement owner from maintaining a structure which blocked an easement over the servient tenement owner's property. The district court granted the servient tenement owner summary judgment. The case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was the dominant tenement forfeit its easement?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> It is true that where the nature and extent of the use of an easement is, by its terms, unrestricted, the use by the dominant tenement may be increased or enlarged. But the owner of the dominant tenement may not subject the servient tenement to use or servitude in connection with other premises to which the easement is not appurtenant. And when an easement is being used in such a manner, an injunction will be issued to prevent such use.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The Court found in favor of the dominant tenement, noting that the creation of an additional burden upon the servient tenement owner's property did not constitute forfeiture of the easement, provided that it was possible to server the increased burden. The court also rejected the servient tenement owner's argument that the easement was forfeited by the dominant tenement owner's misuse of the easement by parking cars over the easement. While such misuse could be enjoined, it was not evidence of forfeiture. The court concluded that fact questions as to the reasonableness of the enjoyment of the easement, and whether it was possible to sever the burden created by the enlarged use of the easement precluded summary disposition. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</li>

#### Case: *[Holbrook v. Taylor](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Where homeowners, as licensees, made improvements on their property and an access road with the approval of licensor landowners, the trial court correctly found that homeowners had established an irrevocable right to use the road by estoppel.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee homeowners built a residence on property adjoining the appellant landowners' property. With the permission of the landowners, the homeowners used and maintained an access road owned by the landowners during the period of home construction. After the construction, the homeowners continued to use the roadway to access the public highway. The homeowners claimed a right to the use of the roadway by prescription and by estoppel. The trial court (Kentucky) determined that a right to the use of the roadway by prescription had not been established, but that it had been established by estoppel. The landowners appealed. The Supreme Court affirmed judgment.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did appellee’s acquire the right to use the roadway by estoppel?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> An easement may be created by express written grant, by implication, by prescription, or by estoppel. An easement, such as a right of way, is created when the owner of a tenement to which the right is claimed to be appurtenant, or those under whom he claims title, have openly, peaceably, continuously, and under a claim of right adverse to the owner of the soil, and with his knowledge and acquiescence, used a way over the lands of another for as much as 15 years.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The use of the roadway by the homeowners to get to their home from the public highway, the use of the roadway for the construction of the residence, the general improvement of the premises, and the maintenance of the roadway, all with the actual consent of the landowners or at least with their tacit approval, clearly established that the license to use the subject roadway could not have been revoked.</li>

#### Case: *[Tulk v. Moxhay](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Tulk owned a vacant lot & some nearby houses in a London Sqaure. He sold the vacant lot a 3rd party w/ a sales contract that specified that the owner (BURDENED PARTY), and all heirs and assignees, would maintain the vacant lot as a "pleasure garden," and charge admission = COVENANT.The property is sold many times, eventually passed by divers mesne coveyances to D Moxhay. By the time Moxhay bought the land, the deed said nothing about maintaining the land as a garden.• D admitted he did know about the covenant restricting building on the lot. P Tulk sued for injunction, & force D to abide by the terms of the original agreement P made w/ original buyer.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Was P Tulk entitled to an Injunction, preventing D from building a garden, when D knew about the Covenant which D's prior owner had entered into restricting such gardens?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court here held that if the original covenant is to have any value, it must be enforceable against subsequent purchasers. There are 2 categories of covenants: Negative covenants are an agreement not to do something e.g. not to build a house on the property. Affirmative covenants are an agreement to do something. e.g. to maintain a garden. In general, courts (in England anyway) have held that neg covenants are assignable & run w/ land, while affirmative covenants are not assignable & don’t run w/ land. In the US, affirmative covenants are sometimes enforceable as equitable servitudes.</li>

#### Touch and Concern Land
#### Case: *[Neponsit Property Owners’ Association, Inc., v. Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Plaintiff's lien, arising from covenant, against defendant's real property was enforceable as covenant ran with land; covenant intended to run with land, covenant touched and concerned land, and parties had privity of estate.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Original sale had Covenant, imposing affirmative duty to pay for HOA fees (to Nep for public amenity). Covenant didn’t pertain to this particular land but overall.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does this Covenant Touch & Concern the land? Whether a covenant in a deed of conveyance over a land binds all subsequent owners including purchasers in a judicial sale?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Regardless of the intention of the parties, a covenant will run with the land and will be enforceable against a subsequent purchaser of the land at the suit of one who claims the benefit of the covenant, only if the covenant complies with certain legal requirements. The age-old essentials of a real covenant, aside from the form of the covenant, may be summarily formulated as follows: (1) it must appear that grantor and grantee intended that the covenant should run with the land; (2) it must appear that the covenant is one "touching" or "concerning" the land with which it runs; (3) it must appear that there is "privity of estate" between the promisee or party claiming the benefit of the covenant and the right to enforce it, and the promisor or party who rests under the burden of the covenant. A covenant to pay an annual charge to a property owner's association does touch/concern the land! A covenant must touch or concern the land. Does the covenant impose a burden upon an interest in land, which on the other hand, increases the value in the same & related land?" If yes, then Touch & Concern is satisfied. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Defendant was properly denied judgment on the pleadings as the evidence showed that plaintiff's lien was a valid and enforceable covenant that ran with the land. Regardless of the intention of the parties, a covenant will run with the land and will be enforceable against a subsequent purchaser of the land at the suit of one who claims the benefit of the covenant, only if the covenant complies with the following: (1) it must appear that grantor and grantee intended that the covenant should run with the land; (2) it must appear that the covenant is one "touching" or "concerning" the land with which it runs; (3) it must appear that there is "privity of estate" between the promisee or party claiming the benefit of the covenant and the right to enforce it, and the promisor or party who rests under the burden of the covenant. The covenant in this case may properly be said to touch and concern the land and its burden should run with the land since it created an easement or right of common enjoyment not just with defendant’s property, but all other property owners who would stand benefited by the maintenance of the roads and public places.</li>

#### Notice Requirement
#### Case: *[Eagle Enterprise, Inc. v. Gross](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A covenant requiring the owner of land to buy water from a particular source was held unenforceable because it did not sufficiently touch and concern the land.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondent purchased land under a deed containing a covenant whereby the owner of the land would purchase water from appellant. According to the stipulated facts, respondent refused to accept and pay for water offered by appellant since he has constructed his own well to service what is now a year-round dwelling. Appellant, therefore, instituted this action to collect the fee specified in the covenant (contained only in the original deed to the subdivision owner Baum) for the supply of water which, appellant contends, respondent is bound to accept. The action was styled as one "for goods sold and delivered" even though respondent did not utilize any of appellant's water. Two of the lower courts found that the covenant "ran" with the land and, hence, was binding upon respondent as successor to the Baums, but the Appellate Division reversed and held that the covenant could not be enforced against respondent. The Court of Appeals of New York affirmed the appellate court's dismissal of the complaint</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is the promise of the original grantees to accept and make payment for a seasonal water supply from the well of their grantor enforceable against subsequent grantees and may be said to "run with the land?" </li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Regardless of the express recital in a deed that a covenant will run with the land, a promise to do an affirmative act contained in a deed is generally not binding upon subsequent grantees of the promisor. For a covenant to run with the land, it must be shown that: (1) the original grantee and grantor intended that the covenant run with the land, (2) there exists "privity of estate" between the party claiming the right to enforce the covenant and the party upon whom the burden of the covenant is to be imposed, and (3) the covenant must "touch and concern" the land with which it runs. Even though the parties to the original deed expressly state in the instrument that the covenant will run with the land, such a recital is insufficient to render the covenant enforceable against subsequent grantees if the other requirements are not met.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The covenant for water supply did not sufficiently touch and concern the land to be enforceable. Even though the parties to the original deed expressly state in the instrument that the covenant will run with the land, such a recital is insufficient to render the covenant enforceable against subsequent grantees if the other requirements for the running of an affirmative covenant are not met.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Defendants properly enjoined from erecting gasoline station on lot as reciprocal negative easement burdened all lots, and lot owners were charged with carrying out and continuing common residential scheme.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> A subdivision was planned as a group of residential properties. One of the buyers sold their residential property to defendants. Defendants wanted to build a gas station in the neighborhood, and the subdivision filed suit to stop them.Defendants insisted that no restrictions appeared in the chain of title and they purchased the land without notice of any reciprocal negative easement</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is defendants' lot subject to a reciprocal negative easement? </li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> In a common development scheme, there are restrictions that are outside the direct chain of title as long buyers are deemed to have constructive notice. A reciprocal negative easement attaches to all land in a common development scheme.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> On appeal, the court upheld the decree, stating that restrictions were upon defendants' lot while it was still in the hands of common owners. Further, the abstract of title to defendants' lot revealed the common owners and the record showed deeds of lots in the plat were restricted to perfect and carry out the general plan which resulted in a reciprocal negative easement upon defendants' lot and all lots within its scope. Defendants and their predecessors in title were bound by constructive notice under the recording acts. For 30 years, the united interests of all persons interested had carried out the common purpose of making and keeping all lots strictly residential, and defendants were the first to depart therefrom.</li>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Presence of some home based businesses in violation of restrictive covenant were not habitual and substantial violations constituting abandonment of covenant to prevent respondent from enforcing it against a home day-care.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellant began operating a day-care in their residence. A restrictive covenant prohibited home businesses in the neighborhood, and appellant's property was subject to the covenant. Appellee sued to enjoin the day-care operation. The trial court concluded that the day-care was a business, the appellee had an equitable right to enforce the covenant, and enjoined appellant from operating the day care. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred by enjoining his day-care business because the restrictive covenant was abandoned or violated public policy. Appellant also asserted the defenses of laches and equitable estoppel. The appellate court affirmed the trial court’s order.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the trial court err in enjoining appellant’s day-care business because the restrictive covenant was abandoned, or violated public policy?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Abandonment of a covenant requires proof that prior violations have eroded the general plan, and enforcement is therefore inequitable. A covenant is abandoned when it has been habitually and substantially violated. But a few violations do not constitute abandonment.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> While there was evidence of other home businesses in the neighborhood, these violations were neither habitual nor substantial, and therefore did not constitute abandonment of the covenant. Appellant did not demonstrate material changes in neighborhood to defeat enforcement of the covenant. The trial court's findings were amply supported by the evidence, and supported its conclusions of law that the covenant had not been abandoned through disuse. The covenants also did not violate public policy.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b>Landowner created nuisance when he began using anthracite coal in his kiln to cure brick and sulfuric acid gas was released, causing his neighbor's trees to die; landowner was enjoined from using anthracite coal and required to pay damages.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> P landowners had ornamental trees destroyed by D’s brickyard that was not in operation when P purchased land.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did D brickyard commit Nuisance?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To constitute a nuisance, use must produce a tangible & appreciable injury to neighboring property, or render its enjoyment uncomfortable/inconvenient. Every person may exercise exclusive dominion over his own property. But, this is limited by the principle of sic utero: use what is yours so as not to injure others. But, does not mean that 1 may never use his property in a way that injures neighbor though. This principle does not prohibit all injury to others; landowner can do some activities though they will harm others for policy reasons.Every person is bound to make reasonable use of his property so that he does not cause unnecessary damage/annoyance to his neighbor.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Yes, P wins; granted Injunction against D brickyard. Are any Defenses applicable here? D could argue: Intermittent, not continuous = ct disagreed, b/c it happened often enough. Even though the sulfuric acid only went on the last few days & only when the wind blew from the south, that was enough. Easement by prescription = Like AP, easement by prescription may allow someone to commit a nuisance if they have been doing it long enough. Court disagrees, b/c there was a 20-year statutory period req, which was not met. - Like HOWARD v. KUNTO, homes only occupied during summer still satisfied continuity req. Coming to the Nuisance = ct disagreed, b/c Landowners are not allowed to control the future uses of neighbors. Estoppel or Acquiescence = We have discussed various other instances of estoppel where ppl are prohibited from enforcing rights that they would otherwise have, b/c of what they have done themselves. Court disagrees; this situation doesn't apply here. - When P bought land, he didn't know that D would be burning bricks. - Before D began burning bricks again, P asked him not to do so. P did nothing that would allow it. = Defenses all fail! So we have a Nuisance.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff landowners neighbored defendant's cement factory. Plaintiffs sought an injunction for property damages from the factory's vibration, smoke, and dirt. The lower court found the factory a nuisance and ordered temporary damages, but denied an injunction.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Should an injunction should issue once a nuisance has been determined despite marked disparity in economic consequence between the effect of the injunction and the effect of the nuisance?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Where a nuisance has been found, and there has been any substantial damage shown by the party complaining, an injunction will be granted.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Where a nuisance has been found and where there has been any substantial damage shown by the party complaining an injunction will be granted even if there is marked disparity in economic consequence between the effect of the injunction and the effect of the nuisance. The court found it should not try to lay down a policy for the difficult problem of pollution elimination as the byproduct of private litigation. The court determined permanent damages were allowed where the loss recoverable is small in comparison with the cost of removal of the nuisance. The court further indicated permanent damages were appropriate when there was a continuing and recurrent nuisance, as in this case. The court found it equitable to award plaintiffs permanent damages based on the theory of compensation for servitude on the land which precluded future recovery by plaintiffs or their grantees. The court granted an injunction which was vacatable upon defendant's payment of permanent damages.</li>

#### Case: *[Spur Industries Inc v. Del E. Webb Development Co.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Defendant was permanently enjoined from operating cattle feedlots that were deemed a nuisance. Plaintiff, having brought people to the nuisance, was ordered to indemnify defendant for his costs of relocating or shutting down the feedlots.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Defendant owned cattle feedlots prior to the construction of plaintiff's nearby residential development. Plaintiff sued defendant, claiming that the feedlots were a public nuisance because of the flies and odor that drifted toward the development. The trial court permanently enjoined defendant from operating the feedlots. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court permanently enjoining the feedlot operations, holding that the feedlots were both a public and private nuisance. Plaintiff, having brought people to the nuisance, was ordered to indemnify defendant for his damages proximately caused by the injunction. The case was remanded for further proceedings on damages issue.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Was the Court correct in ruling that the feedlots were a public nuisance?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>The difference between a private nuisance and a public nuisance is generally one of degree. A private nuisance is one affecting a single individual or a definite small number of persons in the enjoyment of private rights not common to the public, while a public nuisance is one affecting the rights enjoyed by citizens as a part of the public.

#### Zoning

#### Case: *[Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> An injunction against enforcement of a local zoning ordinance that imposed certain building restrictions was not proper because the ordinance was a valid exercise of municipal authority and the landowner was unable to prove that he had been injured.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Appellee, Amber Realty Company (Amber Realty), was the owner of a tract of land containing 68 acres, situated in the westerly end of the village, abutting on Euclid Avenue to the south and the Nickel Plate railroad to the north. On November 13, 1922, an ordinance was adopted by the council of the Village of Euclid, establishing a comprehensive zoning plan for regulating and restricting the location of trades,  industries, apartment houses, two-family houses, single family houses, etc., the lot area to be built upon, the size and height of buildings, etc. The entire area of the village is divided by the ordinance into six classes of use districts, denominated U-1 to U-6. Amber Realty’s tract of land comes under U-2, U-3 and U-6. After the imposition of the zoning plan, Amber Realty instituted an action against the village and its building inspectors. According to Amber Realty, because of the building restrictions imposed, the ordinance operated to reduce the normal value of his property, and to deprive him of liberty and property without due process of law; thereby, violating his Fourteenth Amendment rights. The village and the building inspectors, on the other hand, argued that the ordinance passed constitutional muster and should have been enforced. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio held that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void, and enjoined its enforcement. The municipal corporation and its inspector sought review.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Was the ordinance, which established a comprehensive zoning plan in the Village of Euclid, constitutional?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Before a zoning ordinance can be declared unconstitutional, it must be said that its provisions are clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The Court held that the ordinance, in its general scope and dominant features, was a valid exercise of authority. According to the Court, Amber Realty’s property had not suffered or been threatened with an injury that entitled it to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance. The Court opined that the restrictions imposed bore a rational relation to the health and safety of the community.</li>

### Remainders

#### Case: *[Brokaw v. Fairchild](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>A life tenant may not use his land in a manner that causes permanent injury to the inheritance.
</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>In 1886, Isaac V. Brokaw (testator) purchased a plot of land in New York City, located across the street from Central Park. The testator built a three-story residence on one corner of his land. The residence is suitable as a private single-family residence only. In 1913, the testator passed away, leaving a life estate in the residence to four remaindermen, who were to hold the property successively. The first remainderman, Brokaw (plaintiff), took possession that year. Since then, the character of the neighborhood surrounding the residence changed so that fewer and fewer private residences remained in the area. Brokaw attempted to rent the residence but found there was no market for rental of private residences. Brokaw eventually made plans to tear down the residence and construct a 172-room apartment building in its place, estimating he would make a $30,000 profit instead of the annual loss he had sustained in maintaining the private residence. Brokaw therefore brought this action for a declaration and judgment granting him the authority to replace the residence with an apartment building, despite the objections of the remaindermen.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>May a Life Tenant demolish an inherited bldg, against Remaindermen’s wishes, if the as-is property is less valuable?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>Ameliorative waste is a type of affirmative waste and is impermissible</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>No, P could not demolish b/c that’d be Waste. The Life Estate granted was for both the property & the actual mansion; Grantor intended to leave mansion intact.</li>

#### Case: *[Mountain Brow Lodge No. 82, Independent Order of Odd Fellows v. Toscano](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>A restriction in a gift deed to a fraternal order relating to the use of the property created a valid condition subsequent that was operative even though the effect of the restriction was to restrain absolutely the alienability of the property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>The property at issue was gifted to appellant fraternal order, but the deed restricted the use and benefit of the property to appellant only. In affirming the judgment for respondents, trustees and administrators of the grantors' estates, the court first held that a restraint on alienation also contained in the deed was severable from the restriction on use and did not render the use restriction invalid. Turning to the use restriction, the court held that it created an enforceable condition subsequent on the estate granted, with title to revert to respondents if the land ceased to be used for lodge, fraternal, and the similar purposes for which appellant was formed. The court held that although the condition had the effect of destroying the alienability of the land, it was not invalid. The court noted that the distinction between a covenant which restrained the alienation of a fee simple absolute and a condition that restricted land use and created a defeasible estate was long recognized at common law and remained recognized in California.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether the use condition created a defeasible fee.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>The distinction between a covenant which restrains the alienation of a fee simple absolute and a condition which restricts land use and creates a defeasible estate was long recognized at common law, and is recognized in California. Thus, conditions restricting land use may be upheld by the California courts even though they hamper, and often completely impede, alienation.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The court affirmed the judgment for respondents, trustees and administrators. The court held that the restriction on use contained in a gift deed to appellant fraternal lodge was a valid and enforceable condition subsequent even though it was tantamount to a restrain on alienation.</li>

#### Ownership Between Co-Owners

#### Case: *[Delfino v. Vealencis](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Court erred deciding subordinate facts and failed to consider all parties' interests, thus, partition by sale of tenant in common property improper because facts insufficient to overcome preference for partition in kind.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Plaintiffs and defendant owned a rectangular twenty acre parcel of land as tenants in common. Defendant occupied a dwelling and operated a garbage removal business from the land but neither party occupied the remainder of the area. Plaintiff then brought an action for partition by sale but defendant insists on partition in kind. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and ordered a partition by sale since defendant’s proposal cannot be obtained without material injury to both of them. This was reversed on appeal.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether a partition by sale is justified considering the shape of the subject property and location of defendant’s dwelling.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>A partition by sale should be ordered only when two conditions are satisfied: (1) the physical attributes of the land are such that a partition in kind is impracticable or inequitable; and (2) the interests of the owners would better be promoted by a partition by sale.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>A partition in kind was favored over partition by sale. Partition by sale should be ordered only when two conditions are met: physical attributes of the land render partition in kind impracticable or inequitable; and owners' interest would better be promoted by a partition by sale. The court found that the lower court failed to recognize the shape of the parcel and location of dwelling made partition in kind particularly feasible. The court further found error in the finding that city planning commission would withhold subdivision approval based on defendant's business operations.</li>

#### Contribution & Accounting

#### Case: *[Gillmor v. Gillmor](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Plaintiff's clear demand that defendant share land coupled with defendant's refusal to accommodate plaintiff established a claim. Plaintiff did not have to graze her animals on land, thereby damaging land, to have established her right to a claim.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Two brothers, the parties' fathers, Frank and Edward Lincoln Gillmor, had owned the land and used it for their ranching business. Upon the death of Frank Gillmor, his one-half interest in the property passed in equal shares to his sons, the defendant and C. Frank Gillmor. Edward Lincoln Gillmor continued the ranching business. For several years they grazed cattle and sheep on portions of the common properties. Upon the death of Edward Lincoln Gillmor, his one-half interest passed to his daughter, the plaintiff Florence Gillmor, and she, C. Frank, and the defendant became tenants in common. In May 1979, the plaintiff filed the instant suit for an accounting and damages for the defendant's exclusive use of the property since January 1, 1979. She also filed a separate suit for partition of the common properties. The trial was divided into two phases covering different time periods. Following the award to plaintiff, defendant appealed. The court affirmed ruling in part and reversed it in part, holding first that plaintiff's clear demand that defendant share the land coupled with defendant's refusal to accommodate plaintiff established a claim for relief. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Is it true that there was no evidence or finding on the issue of ouster? Even if there were an ouster, were the damages considered excessive?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>Mere exclusive use of commonly held properties by one co-tenant is not sufficient to establish an ouster. A tenant in common has the right to use and occupy the entire property held in co-tenancy without liability to other co-tenants. Each co-tenant has the right to free and unobstructed possession without liability for rents for the use and occupation.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The defendant contends that the trial court erred in finding that the defendant had exercised exclusive possession and use of the common properties in such a manner as to exclude the plaintiff from using the land. We disagree. The plaintiff sought to graze livestock on the land to the extent of her interest, but was effectively prevented from doing so. She sent defendant a letter expressing her intent to graze her livestock on the properties in proportion to her ownership and requested that the defendant accommodate her plans by altering his operations accordingly. The defendant refused to respond and continued to graze the lands to their maximum capacity. He even acknowledged that additional grazing would have damaged the range land. The defendant asserts that at various times he or his attorney invited the plaintiff onto the lands, but he never indicated any intention to alter his operations so as to accommodate the plaintiff's use of the land. Had the plaintiff grazed her livestock on the common properties while defendant's livestock was also there, the land would have been overgrazed. Indeed, the defendant admitted that if the plaintiff had attempted to put additional sheep on the land, he would have sought an injunction to prevent damage to the land.A co-tenant may, however, be required to contribute his pro rata share of expenses if the co-tenant in possession acted in good faith, with the bona fide belief that he was the sole owner of the property, or when the repairs were essential to preserve or protect the common estate.  Furthermore, where, as here, a co-tenant out of possession seeks an accounting or damages, the co-tenant in possession, who is held liable for the value of the use, occupancy, or rents collected, is entitled to recover reasonable expenditures made by him for necessary repairs and maintenance. In the instant case, the evidence indicates that the repairs were a necessary cost of grazing the livestock and should have been deducted from the damages awarded. The case must therefore be remanded for a modification of the judgment.</li>

#### Severance
#### Case: *[Harms v. Sprague](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Joint tenancy in property was not severed by one joint owner mortgaging his interest in property; mortgage, like property interest, extinguished upon that joint owner's death.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>A man owned property with his brother in joint tenancy. During his lifetime, his brother mortgaged his interest in the property. Upon his brother's death, the man brought an action against the mortgagees and the executor of his brother’s will to quiet title. The trial court ruled in favor of the mortgagees and the executor. On appeal, this was reversed by the appellate court. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Should the action to quiet title approved favor of the living brother?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>A surviving joint tenant succeeds to the share of the deceased joint tenant by virtue of the conveyance which created the joint tenancy, not as the successor of the deceased.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The court ruled that the joint tenancy was not severed when plaintiff's brother mortgaged his interest, because a mortgage is only a lien and does not destroy the unity of title. Further, the court held that the mortgage did not survive the brother's death, because the lien, along with his interest, extinguished upon his death.</li>

#### Entity Property

#### Case: *[Paradine v. Jane](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Term of lease is for three years and the tenant cannot get out of the lease until the term is up. During the civil war in England, Prince Rupert ousted the tenant from the land before the lease was over.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Term of Years lease of agricultural land to tenant at a fixed rent. Tenant can NOT get out of Lease early; stuck. There is a covenant of private enjoyment which was granted by the landlord = promise by the landlord that he will not interfere w/ tenant's possession. But it is not the landlord will prevent any others from interfering with tenant's possession.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>In situations where there are asymmetries of control or info, who should bear risk of something bad happening: landlord or tenant?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Traditional Independent Covenants Model = All covenants must be performed without regard to whether other covenants have been or can be performed. The covenant to pay rent & other covenants are independent from each other. This means that violation of 1 covenant, does not allow other party to violate other covenants. Even if landlord fails to perform a covenant, such as a covenant to repair the premises, the tenant must continue to perform the covenant to pay rent. If tenant fails to perform the covenant to pay rent, the landlord must continue to perform the covenant of quiet possession. Dispossession of property by a 3rd party is the risk that the tenant should bear! The courts today have been moving away from this Independent Model towards Dependent. Residential leases much further from this independent covenant rule, commercial leases perhaps still somewhat closer.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>Tenant has more control over the profit & loss than landlord does. Therefore, tenant should bear risk of loss.</li>

#### Case: *[Smith v. McEnany](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>The tenant had the right to treat an encroachment onto the rented premises, by a wall that was built with the landlord's assent and knowledge of the encroachment, as an eviction determining the lease. This eviction suspended the rent under the lease.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>The tenant rented a lot from the landlord, part of which was covered by a shed that was used by the tenant to store wagons. A permanent brick wall for a building was built on land that adjoined the lot. The adjoining land was owned by the landlord's husband, and the wall encroached onto the lot rented by the tenant. The wall was constructed with the landlord's assent and with her knowledge of the encroachment. Thereafter, the landlord filed an action against the tenant based on his non-payment of rent, and for the breach of a covenant to repair.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether the wrongful eviction of the tenant by the landlord from a part of the premises suspends the rent.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>A wrongful eviction of a tenant by the landlord from a part of the premises suspends the rent under the lease. The main reason is that the enjoyment of the whole consideration is the foundation of the debt and the condition of the covenant, and that the obligation to pay cannot be apportioned. There may be an apportionment when the eviction is by title paramount, or when the lessor's entry is rightful.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The superior court ruled that the tenant had the right to treat the encroachment as an eviction determining the lease, to which the landlord filed exceptions. The court overruled the exceptions and held that the wrongful eviction of the tenant suspended the rent under the lease. The court held that by the terms of the lease as construed, the tenant made it an absolute condition that he should have the whole of the demised premises, at least as against wilful interference on the landlord's part. The court noted that such an eviction did not necessarily end the lease or other obligations of the tenant under it.</li>

#### Case: *[Medico-Dental Building Company of Los Angeles v. Horton & Converse](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Where a lessor breached its restrictive covenant not to lease premises to another entity, who competed against a lessee, the lessee was entitled to vacate the premises without further liability for rent.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Defendant lessee's lease stated that the plaintiff lessor was not to lease any other premises to another entity which operated a drug store. A doctor signed a lease which stated that he was not going to operate a drug store. The lessee advised the lessor about a breach of the restrictive covenant not to lease to a drug store when the doctor began to operate a drug store. When the lessor was unable to stop the doctor's operations, the lessee vacated before another rent payment was due. Plaintiff brought a breach of lease contract action against the lessee. The trial court ruled for the lessee. On appeal, the court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Where a lease contained a covenant that the lessor was "not to lease" to another drug store and the lessee was obligated "to pay rent," did violation of the covenant relieve the lessee of his obligation; the covenant addressing the estate conveyed in the lease and the obligation being a mere contract term?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>While it is true that a lease is primarily a conveyance in that it transfers an estate to the lessee, it also presents the aspect of a contract. This dual character serves to create two distinct sets of rights and obligations -- one comprising those growing out of the relation of landlord and tenant, and said to be based on the privity of estate, and the other comprising those growing out of the express stipulations of the lease, and so said to be based on privity of contract. Those features of the lease, which are strictly contractual in their nature, should be construed according to the rules for the interpretation of contracts generally and in conformity with the fundamental principle that the intentions of the parties should be given effect as far as possible.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The court affirmed the decision for the lessee because, where the covenant ran to the entire consideration of the lease, the restrictive covenant was dependent on the other lease obligations according to the parties' intentions. The doctor clearly operated a legal drug store under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 4030, 4035. The evidence showed that the lessee did not acquiesce in the operation of the doctor's drug store.</li>

    <li><b>Facts:</b>D-Tenant leased a field to graze cattle. Cattle died. Cause was poisonous paint embedded in field’s soil. P & D were not aware. Lease did not include any guarantees or warranties that the grass would be suitable for purpose of cattle eating. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Did T have to pay per K when land was not suited for intended purpose? </li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>If a person enters a lease for the use and occupation of land for a specific purpose, he is bound to that bargain, even though he took it for a particular purpose and that purpose was unattainable. Caveat Lessee = common law rule that even if the property is unsuitable for the intended purpose, the renter still has to pay rent per the contract.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>Where one undertakes to pay a specific rent for a piece of land, he is obliged to pay the rent whether it answers to the purpose for which he took it or not. Benefit by occupation is irrelevant. Forfeiture clauses -» These were clauses in leases invariably insisted upon by landlords, providing that upon the tenant’s violation of enumerated covenants in the lease – most crucially the covenant to pay rent – the tenant’s interest in the lease would be immediately forfeited.Under one form, analogous to the fee simple determinable, the lease forfeits automatically upon violation of specified covenants by the tenant. Under the other form, analogous to the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the violation of specified covenants by the tenant authorizes the landlord to “reenter and retake” the premises.

    <li><b>Overview:</b>Landlords had it within their control to correct conditions that caused tenants to vacate their apartments and, therefore, they were not entitled to collect rent for residences that were not reasonably habitable.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Plaintiff landlords sued defendant tenants to collect past-due rent. Defendant tenants successfully raised the defense of constructive eviction. They claimed that late evening noise from a nearby lounge leased by plaintiff landlords to others violated their implied warranty of quiet enjoyment, and the lower court agreed. Plaintiff landlords appealed the judgment, which the court affirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Did the plaintiff breach defendant tenants' implied warranty of quiet enjoyment?</li>

    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The court affirmed, holding that plaintiff landlords had it within their control to correct the conditions that caused plaintiff tenants to vacate their apartments.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> In an action for breach of a lease, the landlords' acceptance of the tenant's surrender of the lease operated to discharge the tenant from all liability for future rent where the lease contained no acceleration clause.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>The plaintiffs, landlords, filed suit for an alleged breach of commercial lease. The parties had entered into a 20-year lease where the tenant agreed to build and operate a fast-food restaurant. Due to a community opposition, the tenant never completed the construction and repudiated the lease. The tenant never paid any rent on the lease. The trial court granted summary judgment for the landlords, holding that they were not required to accept the repudiation, and referred the matter for a trial as to damages.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Were the commercial landlords entitled to damages?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>When a lessee attempts to repudiate a lease prior to the expiration of its term, the lessor may reject the repudiation and do nothing, in which case the lessee continues to remain liable under the terms of the lease, as there is no obligation for a commercial lessor to mitigate damages. The lessor can also elect to notify the lessee that it is entering the premises and re-letting for the lessee's benefit, in which case the lessee remains liable for any rent deficiency. The lessor also has the option to accept the repudiation, re-enter the premises, and re-let for its own benefit. In that event the lessee is relieved from any further liability under the lease. No further rent accrues because the landlord-tenant relationship no longer exists.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The court determined that the landlords accepted the tenant’s repudiation when they leased to a new tenant. Thus, the landlords were only entitled to accrued rent with interest, the value of the structure for which had already contracted, and attorney’s fees.</li>

    <li><b>Overview:</b> Landlords have an obligation to make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages in wrongfully vacated apartments, and were prevented from recovering when landlord did not rent to a ready, willing, and able replacement tenant.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Defendant tenants signed a residential lease for apartments which they vacated. Landlords sued tenants in two separate cases to collect rent for the entire lease. One trial court dismissed the complaint, which was reversed on appeal. The other trial court granted of summary judgment for the landlord, which was affirmed on appeal. Both defendants appealed. In one case, plaintiff landlord said he did not attempt to re-let, and even denied a potential tenant the opportunity to rent the vacated apartment. The other plaintiff did not respond to interrogatories posited during discovery. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Were the landlords entitled to recover rent due under the leases regardless of whether they had attempted to re-let the vacated apartments?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>Antiquated real property concepts which served as the basis for the pre-existing rule, shall no longer be controlling where there is a claim for damages under a residential lease. Such claims must be governed by more modern notions of fairness and equity. A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages where he seeks to recover rents due from a defaulting tenant.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The state supreme court reversed, holding that landlords had an obligation to make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages with respect to the wrongfully vacated apartments. Therefore, the court overruled Joyce v. Bauman, 113 N.J.L. 438 (E. & A. 1934), to the extent it was inconsistent with its decision. Thus, the judgment of one case was reversed where the plaintiff landlord did not mitigate his damages and could have re-leased the apartment right away.

#### Implied Warranty of Habitability

#### Case: *[Javins v. 1st National Realty Corp.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Tenants could not be evicted for nonpayment of rent where numerous housing code violations existed at their property and common law rule that placed burden of repair on tenants was displaced by housing code.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>By separate written leases, each of the appellants rented an apartment in a three-building apartment complex in Northwest Washington known as Clifton Terrace. The landlord, First National Realty Corporation, filed separate actions in the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Court of General Sessions on April 8, 1966, seeking possession on the ground that each of the appellants had defaulted in the payment of rent due for the month of April. The tenants, appellants here, admitted that they had not paid the landlord any rent for April. However, they alleged numerous violations of the Housing Regulations as "an equitable defense or [a] claim by way of recoupment or set-off in an amount equal to the rent claim," as provided in the rules of the Court of General Sessions. The lower court allowed the evictions, finding proof of housing code violations was inadmissible when proffered as a defense to an eviction action for nonpayment of rent. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Can violations of the Housing Regulations, which arise during the term of a lease, permit  tenants to not comply with their obligation to pay rent?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>The tenant's obligation to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord's performance of his obligations, including his warranty to maintain the premises in habitable condition. In order to determine whether any rent is owed to the landlord, the tenants must be given an opportunity to prove the housing code violations alleged as breach of the landlord's warranty. A warranty of habitability, measured by the standards set out in the Housing Regulations for the District of Columbia, is implied by operation of law into leases of urban dwelling units covered by those regulations and that breach of this warranty gives rise to the usual remedies for breach of contract.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed with the lower court because leases should have been viewed as contracts, and modern contract law implied warranties of quality to meet expectations of buyers. In addition, the comprehensive regulatory scheme of the housing code displaced the common law no-repair rule and is to be abandoned in favor of an implied warranty of habitability. The common law "no-repair" rule, which placed the burden of repair on tenant, was no longer valid because modern urban tenants' interest in property had nothing to do with the land itself, but was an interest in having suitable living quarters. If housing code violations existed, but part of back rent was owed and the tenants agreed to pay, a judgment of possession could not have been entered. As such, the Court reversed and remanded the case.</li>

    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>“Public use” should be interpreted broadly as “public purpose”—i.e., the property need not be available to the entire general public as long as the use confers a public benefit. The Connecticut Supreme Court held that all of the takings were valid. The taking was valid because it was part of an economic plan as a whole. Economic development is a “public use.”</li>

#### Case: *[Goldstein v. New York Urban Development Corporation](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Government plan to make the Barclays center and a mixed use residential development. Some residents held out selling property to the corporation so the government took it. NY state statute was to take land that is blighted so the government said the land was blighted so they could take it.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Can government take land that they deem is blighted?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>Eminent Domain is ok if blighted; if any reasonable person would agree that this was blighted, then it is ok; whether this bar is too low, is for legislature to decide, b/c it requires weighing Public v. Private Interests.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>Yes. This is a taking or public use because there only needs to be a public purpose and blight removal is in the NY constitution. A reasonable person COULD conclude the area was blighted.</li>

#### Case: *[In Re Kaur, In Re Truck Away Inc.](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b>Empire State Development Corporation's exercise of its power of eminent domain to acquire business owners' property for development of new Columbia University campus was proper, where it was supported by a sufficient public use, benefit, or purpose and two reports prepared by consultants arrived at the conclusion that the project site was blighted.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Manhattanville has some property and Columbia University wants that property. They conducted a study and determined the land was blighted.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>For landowners; taking was unconstitutional. (later overturned for industry, b/c disagreed w/ GOLDSTEIN). This court said it violated the NY constitution and the priciples of social conrtact. And the Universities expansion ws not a civil project designated by the statute because it cant just be for an education institution it needs to be educational for civil purpose. This was revered by the New York Court of Appeals (highest NY court) because they had just previously decided Goldstein and this court was bound by that decision.</li>
