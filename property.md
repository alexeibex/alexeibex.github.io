## 1.0 Introduction

#### Class Themes:
No single unifying theory of property. Numerous older doctrines and rules that pervade modern facts and issues. Resurgent movement to change methodology and provide unfiying theory of property.
#### Questions
- Does an element of time matter?
- How long ago was it acquired?
- How it was acquired?
  - Trespass is wrong. But trespass long enough and acquire ownership.
- Transfer of ownership
  - Position in lines
    - DC circuit prohibited line standing for viewing cases
    - US Supreme Court banned line standing
- What sorts of things can be owned?
  - Should you own something if you are first?
  - If you suffered?
- Who determines the rules?
  - Law or Custom?


### 1.1 Acquisition and Claim Scope
Reading: Pages 57–69 & 72–82​

##### Acquisition & Ownership
- Real Property v. Personal Property
 - Real Property = Dirt & Buildings (Focus)
 - Personal Property = Personal Goods & Tangibles + IP

#### First/Subsequent Possession
#### Case: *[Pierson v. Post](Link)*

<summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Hunter had no rights to a fox merely because he was chasing it, and did not suffer injury or damage when interceptor shot the fox, even though he knew it was being chased by hunter.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b>Post(∆) in possession of dogs and hounds was in pursuit of a fox on a wild, uninhabited, waste land called the beach. Pierson (π) knowing fox was so hunted and pursued, chased after fox and killed it, carrying it off.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether Post(∆) by pursuit with his hounds in the manner alleged in his declaration, acquired such a right to/property in the fox. Narrow question is what amounts to occupancy of acquiring right to wild animals? What constitutes posession?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b>Judgement Reversed. A fox is a ferae naturae (wild by nature) and that property of animals is acquired by <b>occupancy only</b> aka posession.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Majority Opinon: Preserving peace and order in society.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of certainty, would prove a fertile source of quarrels and litigation</li>
        <li>Bright Line Rule = TEST: Possession if either the person has BOTH mortally wounded the animal + not abandoned pursuit, OR trapped the animal depriving of natural liberty</li>
        <li>Rule tries to establish certainty of ownership</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Dissenting Opinion: Preserve the encouragement and incentivize the destruction of a pest</li>
      <ul>
        <li>TEST: Property in wild animals can be established without actual contact IF pursuer is within reach/has a reasonable prospect of taking the animal</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Institutional Remedy: Should have been handled by sportsmen, which would not have interfered with hunting custom (Votery of Diana)</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Social Context of Case: Fox hunting was purely social.</li>
      <li>Nouveaux Riche v. Old Money Hunter</li>
      <li>Property includes various concerns. Wealth/Status</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Who should actually "own" the fox?
  - Proof of Work?
    - Pierson who caught the fox?
    - Post who chased the fox?
      - What if he was an incompetent hunter?
      - Counterfactual Argument = "But For" Post chasing the fox Pierson would not have caught the fox.
    - When does the causal windo begin
      - Start of Fox's life?
      - When Post/Pierson see the fox
  - Characteristics of the Fox
    - Who changed the "free will" of the fox?


#### Case: *[Ghen v. Rich](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Court granted libellant fisherman judgment in action for conversion of fin-backwhale because local usage that fisherman who shoots a whale with identifiable bomb-lance, letting it sink, then pays fee to whale's finder, granted title.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Fin-backwhales frequent Massachusetts bay where fishermen shoot and kill the whales. Whales then sink to the ocean floor and rise up 1-3 days later. Whales then either float to beach, are picked up or float out to sea. Each fisherman uses their own unique lance to mark the whale. ∆ found such whale and advertised on the spot for the sale of the whale.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Can local custom allow for possession and claim of title.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Whale, being a ferae naturae, does not become property until a firm possession has been established by the taker.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>No Application of Pierson Test</li>
      </li>A custom among whalemen in the Arctic seas, that the iron holds the whale, is reasonable and valid to bestow title upon the party who first harpoons a whale. The usage for the first iron, whether attached to the boat or not, to hold the whale, is fully established.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Judgement Reversed. A whale is a ferae naturae (wild by nature) and that property of animals is acquired by <b>occupancy only</b>. Narrow question is what amounts to occupancy of acquiring right to wild animals?</li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Application of rule for Pierson v. Post, Whale Company would lose
    - Mortal Wounding and non abandonment of pursuit - leaving whale results in breaking off pursuit.
    - Trapping to deprive of liberty
  - Whales are different than foxes
    - Context of chasing whale v. fox
  - Custom Prevails because it is reasonable and is necessary limited application.
    - Rule works in practice
    - Necessary to continue the industry or else no one would whale hunt.
  - Should judges follow custom even if it is contrary to law.
    - Legislation may not fall in line with custom.
    - Potential problems with Custom
      - Small group will develop a custom that is good for group but that it is not good for society as a whole.
        - Jim Crow Custom/Laws
        - Ivy League Admission on Jewish Applicants
      - What custom governs between competing customs?
        - Are judges likely able to understand nuiances of custom?
  - Case before court is to sort out custom v. legislation and provide clairty and issue settled.
    - Amount awarded was probably more to litigate than cost of damages.

#### 1.2 Open Access and the Commons
- *"The Tragedy of the Commons"*
- **Elinor Ostrom *Governing the Commons*
  - The degredation of the environment to be expected whenever many individuals use a scarce resource in common.
  - Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited.
- Modern Tragedy of the Commons
  - Overfishing
  - Pollution
  - Global Warming/CO2 Emissions
- Solutions to the Tragey of the Commons
  1. Central Planning/Government/Corporation (Leviathan)
    - Inherently Coersive
    - Prone to Error due to lack of information
      - Microsoft v. Apple Example
        - Steve Balmer - "There is no chance that the iPhone will get any significant marketshare, no chance"
        - Microsoft had access to necessary resources to build mobile product and yet they completely failed.
  2. Private Property
    - Allows owner to internalize cost but reap the benefits of their own property.
    - Requires security, monitoring, and defense of property
    - Risk allocation problems
      - Plot may be in an area that is not beneficial
      - Requires insurance against risk
- Property is an institution

## 2.0 Water Rights
Reading: Pages 57-69 & 72-82
#### Definition of Water
- Fugitive Resource with a flow that is only partly predictable.
- Renewable Resource
- Water law consists of a common law base with state statutory and federal overlays.
- Law Distinguishes water along two axes:
  - Surface v. Underground
  - Diffuse v. In a defined channel/body

### 2.1 Watercourses
- A riparian (relating to or situated on the banks of a river) owner = one whose land abuts the watercourse, and riparian water rights are apppurtenant to the land
  - The rights to the land and the right to use the water from the surface stream form a package that cannot be split up.
  - Natural Flow Theory v. Reasonable Use Theory
    - English law developed where each owner could prevent any diversion of the natural flow of a river or stream by an upstream riparian owner
    - American law adopts more flexible theory of reasonable use

### 2.2 Reasonable Use Theory

### Riparian Rights
#### Case: *[Evans v. Merriweather](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-evans-v-merriweather-1667897126.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A judgment for plaintiff in an action for obstructing and diverting a water course was affirmed because defendant had not made a reasonable use of the running water and had injured plaintiff by diverting all of the water into his own well.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Merriweather against Evans for obstructing and diverting a water course.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can riparian proprietors use as much water as they want from a stream on their land?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> There may be, and there must be, of that which is common to all, a reasonable use. The true test of the principle and extent of the use is, whether it is to the injury of the other proprietors or not. There may be diminution in quantity, or a retardation or acceleration of the natural current, indispensable for the general and valuable use of the water, perfectly consistent with the use of the common right. The diminution, retardation, or acceleration, not positively and sensibly injurious, by diminishing the value of the common right, is an implied element in the right of using the stream at all. The law here, as in many other cases, acts with a reasonable reference to public convenience and general good, and is not betrayed into a narrow strictness, subversive of common use, nor into an extravagant looseness, which would destroy private rights. That of a thing common by nature, there may be an appropriation by general consent or grant. Mere priority of appropriation of running water, without such consent or grant, confers no exclusive right.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Affirmed with cost. The Court held that without a contract or a grant, neither owner has a right to use all the water, because all have a right to participate in its benefits. Because of this, the upstream owner may only use as much as is necessary to satisfy his natural needs, and has to leave enough for the downstream owner's natural needs. This is because while manufactures promote the prosperity and comfort of mankind, it is not considered absolutely necessary to his existence, nor is the machinery which would be used from the water power.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Justice upon the whole has been done and because damages are so small, the case should not be sent back for a jury to consider.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

- American reasonable use doctrine is like the law of nuisance in torts in the sense that a wide variety of contextual factors are relevant in determining whether a diversion is actionable.
  - Courts should consider the purpose of the use
  - Suitability to the water course
  - Economic and Social values at stake
  - Harm Caused
  - Possible accommodation techniques
  - Protection of existing investments
  - Ability of adversely affected riparians to bear the loss
  - Justice
- Riparian rights run with the land and cannot be severed.
  - Riparian Owner A cannot sell his rights to nonriparian owner B
    - Results in parceling of land for access to water (Bowling Alley Parcel)
- *Evans v. Merriweather* draws distinction between natural wants and artifical wants.
  - Domestic v. Other

### Priority by Appropriation
- Statutory Application
- Generally only "beneficial uses" of appropriated water are permitted.
  - Water to flood gophers on land?
- Gives rights to use water in a certain way for a certain period of time - rather than a right to a certain volume of water.
- Water measured in cubic foot per second.
- Eastern v Western Applications
  - Western = Evolved from consumptive water use
  - Eastern = Evolved from water for power non-zero sum game.

#### Case: *[Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-coffin-v-left-hand-ditch-co.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Appellee was entitled to use of water because, absent express statute to the contrary, appellee was the first appropriator of water from the natural stream for a beneficial purpose and had the prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee claimed to be the owner of certain water by virtue of an appropriation. Appellants were the owners of lands that were naturally irrigated by the same water. A portion of appellee's dam was torn out and its diversion of water seriously interfered with by appellants. Appellee brought an action for damages arising out of the trespass and for injunctive relief to prevent repetitions in the future. The trial court found in favor of appellee. Appelants challenged the order but the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands apply to the case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The common law doctrine giving the riparian owner a right to the flow of water in its natural channel upon and over his lands, even though he makes no beneficial use thereof, is inapplicable to Colorado. Imperative necessity, unknown to the countries which gave it birth, compels the recognition of another doctrine in conflict therewith. In the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose has, with the qualifications contained in the constitution, a prior right thereto, to the extent of such appropriation.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands was inapplicable. Instead, the court applied the rule that, in the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose had a prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

### Diffuse Surface Water
- Each landowner has an absolute right to use self-help to repel inflows of these waters
  - To combat the common enemy of surface water, even if it causes damaging flooding to other landowners.
- Modified by judicial policing for reasonableness

### Groundwater

#### Case: *[Higday v. Nickolaus](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Under rule of reasonable use, overlying owner such as city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from land from which it was taken if result was to impair supply of adjoining landowners to their injury.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondent city sought to extract groundwater from wells to supply its growing population. Appellant landowners, a group of farmers, filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunction, requesting a judicial declaration of their rights to percolating waters under their lands and seeking an injunction to prevent the city from infringing on those rights. The trial court dismissed the petition.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the pleaded averments of plaintiffs' petition raise in plaintiffs a property right to the reasonable use of the percolating waters underlying their lands? If so, was defendant city’s threatened use of the percolating waters an infringement of those rights as would be enjoined by equity?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Generally, a basis is made out of equity's interference by injunction to prevent the wrongful diversion of percolating waters by a pleading that establishes the plaintiff's right to the use of the water, that he has suffered or will suffer, legal injury, that the acts of the defendant are the cause of the plaintiff's injury, that the injury, present or threatened, is irreparable, and that no adequate redress can be obtained in an action at law. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the landowners' petition for declaratory relief and injunction against the city and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court held that the landowners stated a real controversy and that a declaratory judgment action was the proper method of obtaining relief in a suit to quiet title to water rights. Under the rule of reasonable use, an overlying owner such as the city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from the land from which it was taken if the result was to impair the supply of the adjoining landowners to their injury. The fundamental measure of the overlying owner's right to use groundwater was whether it was for purposes incident to the beneficial enjoyment of the land from which it was taken. The landowners' petition showed that the landowners were threatened with wrongful invasion of their water rights by the city and that the injury was irreparable</li>

## 3.0 The *Ad Coelum* Rule, Sequential Possession & *Nemo Dat*
### 3.1 The *Ad Coelum Rule*
  - "To whomever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths"
  - Applies to resources discovered beneath the surface
    - Minerals
    - Oil/Gas Deposits
    - Mines/Caves

#### Case: *[Edwards v. Sims](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-edwards-v-sims.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Petitioner property owners sought a writ of prohibition against respondent judge of the Edmonson Circuit Court (Kentucky), to prevent the judge from enforcing an order permitting the inspection of a cave on their property and punishing them for contempt for any disobedience of the order.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The property owners possessed land on which caves were situated. The judge of the lower court entered an order that surveyors were permitted to enter upon the land to survey a cave for the purpose of securing evidence on an issue as to whether or not a part of the cave was being exploited under the lands of another party. The property owners claimed that the lower court was without jurisdiction or authority to order the inspection and sought a writ of prohibition against the judge. Upon review, the court denied the writ of prohibition. The case was elevated to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can the Court permit inspection of a cave in one's property to secure evidence for a different case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> If a party is deprived of the entire use of his property, it is a taking, within the scope of the Fifth Amendment, although the mere title is not disturbed; but by an inspection neither the title nor the general use is taken, and all that can be said is that there is a temporary and limited interruption of the exclusive use.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that there was no difference in principle between the invasion of a mine on adjoining property to ascertain whether or not the minerals were being extracted from under the applicant's property and an inspection of the property owner's land through his cave to ascertain whether or not he was trespassing under another person's property. The court found that the lower court judge reviewed surveys of the surface of both parties, but the conflicting opinions were of no assistance to the judge. The judge concluded that the only viable option to ending the controversy was an accurate survey of the cave by an uninterested party.

</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    <b>Majority Opinion:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Caves = to an extent mines and a court of equity however has the inherent power, independent of statute to compel a mine owner to permit an inspection of his works with certain limits:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>The person applying for such an inspection must show a **bona fide** claim and;</li>
          <li>Allege facts showing a necessity for the inspection and examination of the adverse party's property and;</li>
          <li>The party whose property is to be inspected must have had an opportunity to be herd in relation thereto</li>
        </ol>
      <li>"We can see no difference in prcinple between the invasion of a mine on adjoining property to ascertain whether or not the minerals are being extracted from under the applicant's property and an inspection of this respondant's party..."</li>
      <li>Controversy can be quickly and accurately settled by surveying the cave.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <b>Dissenting Opinion:</b></br>
    <ol>
      <li> Trite to say that he who owns the surface of real estate, without reservation owns from the center of the earth to the outmost sentinel of the solar system. = Not true and has never been true.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The rule should be that he who owns the surface is the owner of everything that may be taken from the earth and used for his profit or happiness.</li>
        <li>Applicable to mining but not to the case at hand. "No man can bring up from the depths of the earth the Stygian darkness"</li>
        <li><b>A cave or cavern should belong absolutely to him who owns its entrance.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li>It should not be held that he owns that which he cannot use and which is of no benefit to him and which may be of benefit to others. "Shall a man be allowed to stop airplanes flying above his land because he owns the surface?"</li>
      <li><b>He owns nothing which he cannot subject to his dominion</b></li>
      <li><i>The cave was his because he had made it what it was, and without what he had done it was nothing of value.</i></li>
        <ul>
          <li>That which Edwards owns is something intangible and indefineable. Vision translated into a reality.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
  </ul>

### 3.2 Sequential Possession
- Relativity of Title/Rejection of the *jus tertii* defense (Defense based on the rights of 3rd parties)
- **Trover**: “forced purchase” action for recovery of damages for conversion of personal property, generally measured by the property’s value
  - e.g., the chimney sweep could recover the value of the jewel, but not the jewel itself. Armory.

#### 3.2.1 Prior Possessor Prevails
- The finder’s right of ownership trumps all but the original owner’s right (or earlier finders’ rights).

#### Case: *[Armory v. Delamirie](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π a chimney sweeper's boy found a jewel and carried it to the ∆s (goldsmiths) shop to find it what it was, delivered then to the apprentice. Apprentice weighed the stones and offered 3 halfpence. Boy refused and asked for the jewel back. Apprentice delivered socket without the stones.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does π have claim over the found jewel?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b>
      <ol>
        <li><b>The finder of a jewel, though he does not by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, has a such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner and consequently may maintain trover</b></li>
        <li> That the action will lay against the master, who gives credit to his apprentice, and is answerable for his neglect</li>
        <li>Unless ∆ presented the missing jewel, Jury should presume the strongest against him, and make the value of the best jewels the measure of the damages.
      </ol>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Found in favor of the π</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Trover: Common-law action to recover the value of personal property that has been wrongfully disposed of by another person.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

#### 3.2.2 Subsequent Possession
- TO > F1 > F2. “It’s more mine than yours.”

#### Case: *[Clark v. Maloney](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Action of trover to <b>to recover the value of ten white pine logs</b> which were found by π floating in the Delaware bay after a great freshet, were afterwards taken up and moored with ropes to the mouth of a creek, and in possession of ∆ who refused to give them up alleging they had found them adrift floating up the creek. </li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether or not ∆ can claim the logs from the π</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The finder of a chattel, though he does not acquire an absolute property in it, yet has such a property, as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>π must show first that the logs were his property AND that they were converted by the ∆s to their own use.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Possession is certainly <b>prima facie</b> evidence of property but may be rebutted by evidence of better title.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Loss of chattel does not change the right of property; as the π has shown a special property in these logs, which he never abandoned, which enabled him to keep them against all the world but the rightfulowner</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Case involves sequential possession by two finders. Whould this indirectly encourage theft?</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

</details>

#### 3.2.3 Relative Rights
- The plaintiff’s property right must only be valid relative to the defendant’s right. Property rights are relative.

#### Case: *[Anderson v. Gouldberg](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-anderson-v-gouldberg.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> One who acquired possession of pine logs by trespassing upon the land of some third party had a right to retain that possession against mere wrongdoers who were strangers to the property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The possessor of personal property filed action to recover the possession of 93 pine logs with damages. The possessor claimed that he cut the logs in question and hauled them to a mill from which place strangers took them. The logs in controversy were not cut upon the land of the strangers, and consequently they were entire strangers to the personal property. The trial court entered a judgment for the possessor even though it had found that the possessor had trespassed upon the land in question. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is possession of personal property sufficient title to enable the possessor to recover the property from a stranger who took the property?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Possession only raises a presumption of title. One who takes property from the possession of another can only rebut this presumption by showing a superior title in himself, or in some way connecting himself with one who has. One who acquires possession has a right against a mere wrongdoer who is a stranger to the property. Any other rule leads to an endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals in every case where property once passes out of the possession of the rightful owner. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed and found that plaintiff obtained possession of the logs in the first instance by trespassing upon the land of some third party. When it was said that to maintain replevin plaintiff's possession must have been lawful, it meant that it must have been lawful as against the person who deprived him of the property. Possession was good title against the entire world except those having a better title. Possession only raised a presumption of title. One who took property from the possession of another could only rebut the presumption by showing a superior title in himself or in some way connecting himself with one who had superior title. The court held that one who acquired the possession of property, whether by finding, bailment, or by mere tort, had a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who was a stranger to the property.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

### 3.3 *Nemo Dat*
- *"One cannot give that which one does not have"*
  - You cannot buy the Brooklyn Bridge
- *"Prior in time is prior in right"*
- Property rights are always exclusive
  - Two persons cannot hold the same property right at the same time.
- Current owners must be able to trace their ownership back in time through a series of legitimate transfers (ideally) to an act of legitimate original acquisition.
