## 1.0 Introduction

#### Class Themes:
No single unifying theory of property. Numerous older doctrines and rules that pervade modern facts and issues. Resurgent movement to change methodology and provide unfiying theory of property.
##### Questions
- Does an element of time matter?
- How long ago was it acquired?
- How it was acquired?
  - Trespass is wrong. But trespass long enough and acquire ownership.
- Transfer of ownership
  - Position in lines
    - DC circuit prohibited line standing for viewing cases
    - US Supreme Court banned line standing
- What sorts of things can be owned?
  - Should you own something if you are first?
  - If you suffered?
- Who determines the rules?
  - Law or Custom?


### 1.1 Acquisition and Claim Scope
Reading: Pages 57–69 & 72–82​

##### Acquisition & Ownership
- Real Property v. Personal Property
 - Real Property = Dirt & Buildings (Focus)
 - Personal Property = Personal Goods & Tangibles + IP

#### First/Subsequent Possession
#### Case: *[Pierson v. Post](Link)*

<summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Hunter had no rights to a fox merely because he was chasing it, and did not suffer injury or damage when interceptor shot the fox, even though he knew it was being chased by hunter.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b>Post(∆) in possession of dogs and hounds was in pursuit of a fox on a wild, uninhabited, waste land called the beach. Pierson (π) knowing fox was so hunted and pursued, chased after fox and killed it, carrying it off.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether Post(∆) by pursuit with his hounds in the manner alleged in his declaration, acquired such a right to/property in the fox. Narrow question is what amounts to occupancy of acquiring right to wild animals? What constitutes posession?</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b>Judgement Reversed. A fox is a ferae naturae (wild by nature) and that property of animals is acquired by <b>occupancy only</b> aka posession.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Majority Opinon: Preserving peace and order in society.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of certainty, would prove a fertile source of quarrels and litigation</li>
        <li>Bright Line Rule = TEST: Possession if either the person has BOTH mortally wounded the animal + not abandoned pursuit, OR trapped the animal depriving of natural liberty</li>
        <li>Rule tries to establish certainty of ownership</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Dissenting Opinion: Preserve the encouragement and incentivize the destruction of a pest</li>
      <ul>
        <li>TEST: Property in wild animals can be established without actual contact IF pursuer is within reach/has a reasonable prospect of taking the animal</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Institutional Remedy: Should have been handled by sportsmen, which would not have interfered with hunting custom (Votery of Diana)</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Who should actually "own" the fox?
  - Proof of Work?
    - Pierson who caught the fox?
    - Post who chased the fox?
      - What if he was an incompetent hunter?
      - Counterfactual Argument = "But For" Post chasing the fox Pierson would not have caught the fox.
    - When does the causal windo begin
      - Start of Fox's life?
      - When Post/Pierson see the fox
  - Characteristics of the Fox

<details><summary><i>Case: Ghen v. Rich</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Court granted libellant fisherman judgment in action for conversion of fin-backwhale because local usage that fisherman who shoots a whale with identifiable bomb-lance, letting it sink, then pays fee to whale's finder, granted title.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Fin-backwhales frequent Massachusetts bay where fishermen shoot and kill the whales. Whales then sink to the ocean floor and rise up 1-3 days later. Whales then either float to beach, are picked up or float out to sea. Each fisherman uses their own unique lance to mark the whale. ∆ found such whale and advertised on the spot for the sale of the whale.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Whale, being a ferae naturae, does not become property until a firm possession has been established by the taker.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Judgement Reversed. A fox is a ferae naturae (wild by nature) and that property of animals is acquired by ***occupancy only***. Narrow question is what amounts to occupancy of acquiring right to wild animals?</li>

### 1.1 Open Access and the Commons

1. Establishing Proof of Title
1. First to possess something that is unclaimed by anyone else


## 2.0 Water Rights
Reading: Pages 57-69 & 72-82
###### Definition of Water
- Fugitive Resource with a flow that is only partly predictable.
- Renewable Resource
- Water law consists of a common law base with state statutory and federal overlays.
- Law Distinguishes water along two axes:
  - Surface v. Underground
  - Diffuse v. In a defined channel/body

##### 2.1 Watercourses
- A riparian (relating to or situated on the banks of a river) owner = one whose land abuts the watercourse, and riparian water rights are apppurtenant to the land
  - The rights to the land and the right to use the water from the surface stream form a package that cannot be split up.
  - Natural Flow Theory v. Reasonable Use Theory
    - English law developed where each owner could prevent any diversion of the natural flow of a river or stream by an upstream riparian owner
    - American law adopts more flexible theory of reasonable use

##### 2.2 Reasonable Use Theory

##### Riparian Rights
###### Case: *[Evans v. Merriweather](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-evans-v-merriweather-1667897126.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A judgment for plaintiff in an action for obstructing and diverting a water course was affirmed because defendant had not made a reasonable use of the running water and had injured plaintiff by diverting all of the water into his own well.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Merriweather against Evans for obstructing and diverting a water course.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can riparian proprietors use as much water as they want from a stream on their land?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> There may be, and there must be, of that which is common to all, a reasonable use. The true test of the principle and extent of the use is, whether it is to the injury of the other proprietors or not. There may be diminution in quantity, or a retardation or acceleration of the natural current, indispensable for the general and valuable use of the water, perfectly consistent with the use of the common right. The diminution, retardation, or acceleration, not positively and sensibly injurious, by diminishing the value of the common right, is an implied element in the right of using the stream at all. The law here, as in many other cases, acts with a reasonable reference to public convenience and general good, and is not betrayed into a narrow strictness, subversive of common use, nor into an extravagant looseness, which would destroy private rights. That of a thing common by nature, there may be an appropriation by general consent or grant. Mere priority of appropriation of running water, without such consent or grant, confers no exclusive right.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Affirmed with cost. The Court held that without a contract or a grant, neither owner has a right to use all the water, because all have a right to participate in its benefits. Because of this, the upstream owner may only use as much as is necessary to satisfy his natural needs, and has to leave enough for the downstream owner's natural needs. This is because while manufactures promote the prosperity and comfort of mankind, it is not considered absolutely necessary to his existence, nor is the machinery which would be used from the water power.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Justice upon the whole has been done and because damages are so small, the case should not be sent back for a jury to consider.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

- American reasonable use doctrine is like the law of nuisance in torts in the sense that a wide variety of contextual factors are relevant in determining whether a diversion is actionable.
  - Courts should consider the purpose of the use
  - Suitability to the water course
  - Economic and Social values at stake
  - Harm Caused
  - Possible accommodation techniques
  - Protection of existing investments
  - Ability of adversely affected riparians to bear the loss
  - Justice
- Riparian rights run with the land and cannot be severed.
  - Riparian Owner A cannot sell his rights to nonriparian owner B
    - Results in parceling of land for access to water (Bowling Alley Parcel)
- *Evans v. Merriweather* draws distinction between natural wants and artifical wants.
  - Domestic v. Other

##### Priority by Appropriation
- Statutory Application
- Generally only "beneficial uses" of appropriated water are permitted.
  - Water to flood gophers on land?
- Gives rights to use water in a certain way for a certain period of time - rather than a right to a certain volume of water.
- Water measured in cubic foot per second.
- Eastern v Western Applications
  - Western = Evolved from consumptive water use
  - Eastern = Evolved from water for power non-zero sum game.

###### Case: *[Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-coffin-v-left-hand-ditch-co.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Appellee was entitled to use of water because, absent express statute to the contrary, appellee was the first appropriator of water from the natural stream for a beneficial purpose and had the prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee claimed to be the owner of certain water by virtue of an appropriation. Appellants were the owners of lands that were naturally irrigated by the same water. A portion of appellee's dam was torn out and its diversion of water seriously interfered with by appellants. Appellee brought an action for damages arising out of the trespass and for injunctive relief to prevent repetitions in the future. The trial court found in favor of appellee. Appelants challenged the order but the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands apply to the case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The common law doctrine giving the riparian owner a right to the flow of water in its natural channel upon and over his lands, even though he makes no beneficial use thereof, is inapplicable to Colorado. Imperative necessity, unknown to the countries which gave it birth, compels the recognition of another doctrine in conflict therewith. In the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose has, with the qualifications contained in the constitution, a prior right thereto, to the extent of such appropriation.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands was inapplicable. Instead, the court applied the rule that, in the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose had a prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

##### Diffuse Surface Water
- Each landowner has an absolute right to use self-help to repel inflows of these waters
  - To combat the common enemy of surface water, even if it causes damaging flooding to other landowners.
- Modified by judicial policing for reasonableness

##### Groundwater

##### Case: *[Higday v. Nickolaus](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Under rule of reasonable use, overlying owner such as city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from land from which it was taken if result was to impair supply of adjoining landowners to their injury.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondent city sought to extract groundwater from wells to supply its growing population. Appellant landowners, a group of farmers, filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunction, requesting a judicial declaration of their rights to percolating waters under their lands and seeking an injunction to prevent the city from infringing on those rights. The trial court dismissed the petition.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the pleaded averments of plaintiffs' petition raise in plaintiffs a property right to the reasonable use of the percolating waters underlying their lands? If so, was defendant city’s threatened use of the percolating waters an infringement of those rights as would be enjoined by equity?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Generally, a basis is made out of equity's interference by injunction to prevent the wrongful diversion of percolating waters by a pleading that establishes the plaintiff's right to the use of the water, that he has suffered or will suffer, legal injury, that the acts of the defendant are the cause of the plaintiff's injury, that the injury, present or threatened, is irreparable, and that no adequate redress can be obtained in an action at law. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the landowners' petition for declaratory relief and injunction against the city and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court held that the landowners stated a real controversy and that a declaratory judgment action was the proper method of obtaining relief in a suit to quiet title to water rights. Under the rule of reasonable use, an overlying owner such as the city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from the land from which it was taken if the result was to impair the supply of the adjoining landowners to their injury. The fundamental measure of the overlying owner's right to use groundwater was whether it was for purposes incident to the beneficial enjoyment of the land from which it was taken. The landowners' petition showed that the landowners were threatened with wrongful invasion of their water rights by the city and that the injury was irreparable</li>
