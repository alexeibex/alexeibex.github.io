## 1.0 Introduction

#### Class Themes:
No single unifying theory of property. Numerous older doctrines and rules that pervade modern facts and issues. Resurgent movement to change methodology and provide unfiying theory of property.
#### Questions
- Does an element of time matter?
- How long ago was it acquired?
- How it was acquired?
  - Trespass is wrong. But trespass long enough and acquire ownership.
- Transfer of ownership
  - Position in lines
    - DC circuit prohibited line standing for viewing cases
    - US Supreme Court banned line standing
- What sorts of things can be owned?
  - Should you own something if you are first?
  - If you suffered?
- Who determines the rules?
  - Law or Custom?


### 1.1 Acquisition and Claim Scope
Reading: Pages 57–69 & 72–82​

##### Acquisition & Ownership
- Real Property v. Personal Property
 - Real Property = Dirt & Buildings (Focus)
 - Personal Property = Personal Goods & Tangibles + IP

#### First/Subsequent Possession
#### Case: *[Pierson v. Post](Link)*

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Hunter had no rights to a fox merely because he was chasing it, and did not suffer injury or damage when interceptor shot the fox, even though he knew it was being chased by hunter.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b>Post(∆) in possession of dogs and hounds was in pursuit of a fox on a wild, uninhabited, waste land called the beach. Pierson (π) knowing fox was so hunted and pursued, chased after fox and killed it, carrying it off.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether Post(∆) by pursuit with his hounds in the manner alleged in his declaration, acquired such a right to/property in the fox. Narrow question is what amounts to occupancy of acquiring right to wild animals? What constitutes posession?</li>

#### Case: *[Ghen v. Rich](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b>Court granted libellant fisherman judgment in action for conversion of fin-backwhale because local usage that fisherman who shoots a whale with identifiable bomb-lance, letting it sink, then pays fee to whale's finder, granted title.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Fin-backwhales frequent Massachusetts bay where fishermen shoot and kill the whales. Whales then sink to the ocean floor and rise up 1-3 days later. Whales then either float to beach, are picked up or float out to sea. Each fisherman uses their own unique lance to mark the whale. ∆ found such whale and advertised on the spot for the sale of the whale.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Can local custom allow for possession and claim of title.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Whale, being a ferae naturae, does not become property until a firm possession has been established by the taker.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>No Application of Pierson Test</li>
      </li>A custom among whalemen in the Arctic seas, that the iron holds the whale, is reasonable and valid to bestow title upon the party who first harpoons a whale. The usage for the first iron, whether attached to the boat or not, to hold the whale, is fully established.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Judgement Reversed. A whale is a ferae naturae (wild by nature) and that property of animals is acquired by <b>occupancy only</b>. Narrow question is what amounts to occupancy of acquiring right to wild animals?</li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
</ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
  - Application of rule for Pierson v. Post, Whale Company would lose
    - Mortal Wounding and non abandonment of pursuit - leaving whale results in breaking off pursuit.
    - Trapping to deprive of liberty
  - Whales are different than foxes
    - Context of chasing whale v. fox
  - Custom Prevails because it is reasonable and is necessary limited application.
    - Rule works in practice
    - Necessary to continue the industry or else no one would whale hunt.
  - Should judges follow custom even if it is contrary to law.
    - Legislation may not fall in line with custom.
    - Potential problems with Custom
      - Small group will develop a custom that is good for group but that it is not good for society as a whole.
        - Jim Crow Custom/Laws
        - Ivy League Admission on Jewish Applicants
      - What custom governs between competing customs?
        - Are judges likely able to understand nuiances of custom?
  - Case before court is to sort out custom v. legislation and provide clairty and issue settled.
    - Amount awarded was probably more to litigate than cost of damages.

#### 1.2 Open Access and the Commons
- *"The Tragedy of the Commons"*
- **Elinor Ostrom *Governing the Commons*
  - The degredation of the environment to be expected whenever many individuals use a scarce resource in common.
  - Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited.
- Modern Tragedy of the Commons
  - Overfishing
  - Pollution
  - Global Warming/CO2 Emissions
- Results in Overutilization
- **Solutions to the Tragedy of the Commons**
  1. Central Planning/Government/Corporation (Leviathan)
    - Inherently Coersive
    - Prone to Error due to lack of information
      - Microsoft v. Apple Example
        - Steve Balmer - "There is no chance that the iPhone will get any significant marketshare, no chance"
        - Microsoft had access to necessary resources to build mobile product and yet they completely failed.
  2. Private Property
    - Allows owner to internalize cost but reap the benefits of their own property.
    - Requires security, monitoring, and defense of property
    - Risk allocation problems
      - Plot may be in an area that is not beneficial
      - Requires insurance against risk
    - Property as a utilitarian solution
      - Incentive to invest and reap benefits
- Anti-Commons - Property can create problems of their own
  - Too many people have ownership of a resource
    - Can result in every person has a veto vote and impedes progress
  - Results in underutilization

## 2.0 Water Rights
Reading: Pages 57-69 & 72-82
#### Definition of Water
- Fugitive Resource with a flow that is only partly predictable.
- Renewable Resource
- Water law consists of a common law base with state statutory and federal overlays.
- Law Distinguishes water along two axes:
  - Surface v. Underground (Y Axis)
  - Diffuse v. In a defined channel/body (X Axis)
    - Diffuse treated as a pest
    - Defined Channel as a resource

### 2.1 Watercourses
- A riparian (relating to or situated on the banks of a river) owner = one whose land abuts the watercourse, and riparian water rights are apppurtenant to the land
  - The rights to the land and the right to use the water from the surface stream form a package that cannot be split up.
  - Natural Flow Theory v. Reasonable Use Theory
    - English law developed where each owner could prevent any diversion of the natural flow of a river or stream by an upstream riparian owner
    - American law adopts more flexible theory of reasonable use


### 2.2 Principles of Water Allocation
- Embodies and Underlies the just utilization of property
  1. Natural Flow
  2. Reasonable Use
  3. First Appropriation
  4. Corellative Use

### Natural Flow
  - Every riparian owner has equal access to water
  - Rests on implicit principle of just allocation of property rights
    - Where everyone gets an equal amount
  - Cons: Prevents the use of water for applications that removes water from water course.
  - Use of the water can be gained by getting permission from every riparian owner
  - Anti-Commons Problem
    - Incur Transaction costs/Hold out problems
  - Impededs productive use

### Reasonable Use
- Just allocation of property rights, promotes the reasonably social good uses.
- American reasonable use doctrine is like the law of nuisance in torts in the sense that a wide variety of contextual factors are relevant in determining whether a diversion is actionable.
  - Courts should consider the purpose of the use
  - Suitability to the water course
  - Economic and Social values at stake
  - Harm Caused
  - Possible accommodation techniques
  - Protection of existing investments
  - Ability of adversely affected riparians to bear the loss
  - Justice
- Riparian rights run with the land and cannot be severed.
  - Riparian Owner A cannot sell his rights to nonriparian owner B
    - Results in parceling of land for access to water (Bowling Alley Parcel)
- Problems: What is Reasonable?
  - *Evans v. Merriweather* draws distinction between natural wants and artifical wants.
    - Norms change - Artificial changes
      - Outhouses v. modern plumbling
    - Domestic v. Other

#### Case: *[Evans v. Merriweather](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-evans-v-merriweather-1667897126.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> A judgment for plaintiff in an action for obstructing and diverting a water course was affirmed because defendant had not made a reasonable use of the running water and had injured plaintiff by diverting all of the water into his own well.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b>Merriweather against Evans for obstructing and diverting a water course.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can riparian proprietors use as much water as they want from a stream on their land?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> There may be, and there must be, of that which is common to all, a reasonable use. The true test of the principle and extent of the use is, whether it is to the injury of the other proprietors or not. There may be diminution in quantity, or a retardation or acceleration of the natural current, indispensable for the general and valuable use of the water, perfectly consistent with the use of the common right. The diminution, retardation, or acceleration, not positively and sensibly injurious, by diminishing the value of the common right, is an implied element in the right of using the stream at all. The law here, as in many other cases, acts with a reasonable reference to public convenience and general good, and is not betrayed into a narrow strictness, subversive of common use, nor into an extravagant looseness, which would destroy private rights. That of a thing common by nature, there may be an appropriation by general consent or grant. Mere priority of appropriation of running water, without such consent or grant, confers no exclusive right.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Affirmed with cost. The Court held that without a contract or a grant, neither owner has a right to use all the water, because all have a right to participate in its benefits. Because of this, the upstream owner may only use as much as is necessary to satisfy his natural needs, and has to leave enough for the downstream owner's natural needs. This is because while manufactures promote the prosperity and comfort of mankind, it is not considered absolutely necessary to his existence, nor is the machinery which would be used from the water power.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> Justice upon the whole has been done and because damages are so small, the case should not be sent back for a jury to consider.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Application of Priciples
    - First Posession Theory
      - Evans gets the water before Merriweather
      - Evans "owned" steam mill before Merriweather who accquried from Smith & Baker
      - Merriweather would have claim over water rights through building first steam mill
    - Natural Flow Theory
      - Rejected
    - Reasonable Use
      - Both have a right so long as both uses are:
        - Reasonable AND;
        - Does not injury any other riparian owner than is necessary to accomplish reasonable use.
      - Natural v. Artificial Use
        - Water for needs (drinking)
        - Water for comfort & prosperity
        - Natural use > Artificial Use


### First Appropriation
- Whoever is first gets the right.
- Promotes economic development & efficiency
- Statutory Application
- Generally only "beneficial uses" of appropriated water are permitted.
  - Water to flood gophers on land?
- Gives rights to use water in a certain way for a certain period of time - rather than a right to a certain volume of water.
- Water measured in cubic foot per second.
- Eastern v Western Applications
  - Western = Evolved from consumptive water use
  - Eastern = Evolved from water for power non-zero sum game.

#### Case: *[Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-coffin-v-left-hand-ditch-co.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Appellee was entitled to use of water because, absent express statute to the contrary, appellee was the first appropriator of water from the natural stream for a beneficial purpose and had the prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Appellee claimed to be the owner of certain water by virtue of an appropriation. Appellants were the owners of lands that were naturally irrigated by the same water. A portion of appellee's dam was torn out and its diversion of water seriously interfered with by appellants. Appellee brought an action for damages arising out of the trespass and for injunctive relief to prevent repetitions in the future. The trial court found in favor of appellee. Appelants challenged the order but the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does the common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands apply to the case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> The common law doctrine giving the riparian owner a right to the flow of water in its natural channel upon and over his lands, even though he makes no beneficial use thereof, is inapplicable to Colorado. Imperative necessity, unknown to the countries which gave it birth, compels the recognition of another doctrine in conflict therewith. In the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose has, with the qualifications contained in the constitution, a prior right thereto, to the extent of such appropriation.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The common law doctrine that allowed the riparian owner the natural flow of the water over his lands was inapplicable. Instead, the court applied the rule that, in the absence of express statutes to the contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose had a prior right thereto.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Beginning of Colorodo Statue relies on First Appropriation
    - Reliance on First Approriation has resulted in investment
  - First Appropriation for a beneficial purpose rule
    - Based on climate of area.
      - West = dry and requires irrigation v. East = industrial use


### Diffuse Surface Water
- Each landowner has an absolute right to use self-help to repel inflows of these waters
  - To combat the common enemy of surface water, even if it causes damaging flooding to other landowners.
- Recently modified by judicial policing for reasonableness


### Corellative Rights
- Scope of ownership corrollate to something else
  - Ownership of land corelates to the ownership of the underground water.
- Based on other allocations that are considered just
- Problems:
  - Ability to extract from underground
  - Competing landowners uses
    - Beneficial use v. non-beneficial use

#### Case: *[Higday v. Nickolaus](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Under rule of reasonable use, overlying owner such as city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from land from which it was taken if result was to impair supply of adjoining landowners to their injury.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Respondent city sought to extract groundwater from wells to supply its growing population. Appellant landowners, a group of farmers, filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunction, requesting a judicial declaration of their rights to percolating waters under their lands and seeking an injunction to prevent the city from infringing on those rights. The trial court dismissed the petition.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did the pleaded averments of plaintiffs' petition raise in plaintiffs a property right to the reasonable use of the percolating waters underlying their lands? If so, was defendant city’s threatened use of the percolating waters an infringement of those rights as would be enjoined by equity?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Generally, a basis is made out of equity's interference by injunction to prevent the wrongful diversion of percolating waters by a pleading that establishes the plaintiff's right to the use of the water, that he has suffered or will suffer, legal injury, that the acts of the defendant are the cause of the plaintiff's injury, that the injury, present or threatened, is irreparable, and that no adequate redress can be obtained in an action at law. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the landowners' petition for declaratory relief and injunction against the city and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court held that the landowners stated a real controversy and that a declaratory judgment action was the proper method of obtaining relief in a suit to quiet title to water rights. Under the rule of reasonable use, an overlying owner such as the city could not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away from the land from which it was taken if the result was to impair the supply of the adjoining landowners to their injury. The fundamental measure of the overlying owner's right to use groundwater was whether it was for purposes incident to the beneficial enjoyment of the land from which it was taken. The landowners' petition showed that the landowners were threatened with wrongful invasion of their water rights by the city and that the injury was irreparable</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - All underground water is assumed to be percolating
  - Rejection of first appropriation rule
  - Developes reasonable use standard for ground water
    - Reasonable = Beneficial Use on the land itself
    - Water cannot be extracted and shipped to somewhere else so long as it does not interfere with other users benficially enjoying their properties.
  - City could still use emminant domain to acquire property and water rights

## 3.0 The *Ad Coelum* Rule, Sequential Possession & *Nemo Dat*
### 3.1 The *Ad Coelum Rule*
  - "To whomever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths"
  - Cone of ownership from center of earth to outter reaches of universe
  - Applies to resources discovered beneath the surface
    - Minerals
    - Oil/Gas Deposits
    - Mines/Caves

#### Case: *[Edwards v. Sims](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-edwards-v-sims.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Petitioner property owners sought a writ of prohibition against respondent judge of the Edmonson Circuit Court (Kentucky), to prevent the judge from enforcing an order permitting the inspection of a cave on their property and punishing them for contempt for any disobedience of the order.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The property owners possessed land on which caves were situated. The judge of the lower court entered an order that surveyors were permitted to enter upon the land to survey a cave for the purpose of securing evidence on an issue as to whether or not a part of the cave was being exploited under the lands of another party. The property owners claimed that the lower court was without jurisdiction or authority to order the inspection and sought a writ of prohibition against the judge. Upon review, the court denied the writ of prohibition. The case was elevated to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Can the Court permit inspection of a cave in one's property to secure evidence for a different case?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> If a party is deprived of the entire use of his property, it is a taking, within the scope of the Fifth Amendment, although the mere title is not disturbed; but by an inspection neither the title nor the general use is taken, and all that can be said is that there is a temporary and limited interruption of the exclusive use.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that there was no difference in principle between the invasion of a mine on adjoining property to ascertain whether or not the minerals were being extracted from under the applicant's property and an inspection of the property owner's land through his cave to ascertain whether or not he was trespassing under another person's property. The court found that the lower court judge reviewed surveys of the surface of both parties, but the conflicting opinions were of no assistance to the judge. The judge concluded that the only viable option to ending the controversy was an accurate survey of the cave by an uninterested party.

</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    <b>Majority Opinion:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Caves = to an extent mines and a court of equity however has the inherent power, independent of statute to compel a mine owner to permit an inspection of his works with certain limits:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>The person applying for such an inspection must show a **bona fide** claim and;</li>
          <li>Allege facts showing a necessity for the inspection and examination of the adverse party's property and;</li>
          <li>The party whose property is to be inspected must have had an opportunity to be herd in relation thereto</li>
        </ol>
      <li>"We can see no difference in prcinple between the invasion of a mine on adjoining property to ascertain whether or not the minerals are being extracted from under the applicant's property and an inspection of this respondant's party..."</li>
      <li>Controversy can be quickly and accurately settled by surveying the cave.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <b>Dissenting Opinion:</b></br>
    <ol>
      <li> Trite to say that he who owns the surface of real estate, without reservation owns from the center of the earth to the outmost sentinel of the solar system. = Not true and has never been true.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The rule should be that he who owns the surface is the owner of everything that may be taken from the earth and used for his profit or happiness.</li>
        <li>Applicable to mining but not to the case at hand. "No man can bring up from the depths of the earth the Stygian darkness"</li>
        <li><b>A cave or cavern should belong absolutely to him who owns its entrance.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li>It should not be held that he owns that which he cannot use and which is of no benefit to him and which may be of benefit to others. "Shall a man be allowed to stop airplanes flying above his land because he owns the surface?"</li>
      <li><b>He owns nothing which he cannot subject to his dominion</b></li>
      <li><i>The cave was his because he had made it what it was, and without what he had done it was nothing of value.</i></li>
        <ul>
          <li>That which Edwards owns is something intangible and indefineable. Vision translated into a reality.</li>

### 3.2 Sequential Possession
- Relativity of Title/Rejection of the *jus tertii* defense (Defense based on the rights of 3rd parties)
- **Trover**: “forced purchase” action for recovery of damages for conversion of personal property, generally measured by the property’s value
  - e.g., the chimney sweep could recover the value of the jewel, but not the jewel itself. Armory.

#### 3.2.1 Prior Possessor Prevails
- The finder’s right of ownership trumps all but the original owner’s right (or earlier finders’ rights).

#### Case: *[Armory v. Delamirie](Link)*
-Finder v. Keeper (Earlier Possessor Won)

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b></li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π a chimney sweeper's boy found a jewel and carried it to the ∆s (goldsmiths) shop to find it what it was, delivered then to the apprentice. Apprentice weighed the stones and offered 3 halfpence. Boy refused and asked for the jewel back. Apprentice delivered socket without the stones.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Does π have claim over the found jewel?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>

      <ol>
        <li><b>The finder of a jewel, though he does not by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, has a such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner and consequently may maintain trover</b></li>
        <li> That the action will lay against the master, who gives credit to his apprentice, and is answerable for his neglect</li>
        <li>Unless ∆ presented the missing jewel, Jury should presume the strongest against him, and make the value of the best jewels the measure of the damages.</li>
      </ol>

    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Found in favor of the π. Appropriate measure of damages is the value of the jewel. Jewel was not presented in court as evidence, so value of jewel should be presumed the strongest against the ∆.(Information forcing rule)</li>

    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Trover: Common-law action to recover the value of personal property that has been wrongfully disposed of by another person.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

</details>

- **Class Discussion**
- Both parties can claim that the other is not the true owner of the jewel.
- Finder's property right good against everyone in the world, EXCEPT the true owner.
- Information forcing rule/Penalty faulting Rule
  - Information asymmetry between two parties, and that information is relevent, court provides incentive to provide information.
- "Finders keepers losers weepers" != not an accurate representation of the law.
- Finder acts as a Bailley to the true owner.
  - Finder can sue until the statute of limitaitons runs out.
  - NY State Law on Finders - 1958 hinged on price then, after inflation around $100 today.
    - If the found property is worth less than $10, if you make reasonable efforts and cannot do so, permitted to keep the property after 1 year.
    - If the found property is worth $20 or more, must be turned into police who must hold it for a specified time of up to 3 years, then the finder is entitled to keep it. Punishable by misdomenor, fine and imprisonment.
    - If value of is >10 but <20 the statutes are silent.


#### 3.2.2 Subsequent Possession
- **TO > F1 > F2. “It’s more mine than yours.”**

#### Case: *[Clark v. Maloney](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-clark-v-maloney.aspx)*
-Finder v. Finder (Earlier Possessor Won)

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Action of trover to <b>to recover the value of ten white pine logs</b> which were found by π floating in the Delaware bay after a great freshet, were afterwards taken up and moored with ropes to the mouth of a creek, and in possession of ∆ who refused to give them up alleging they had found them adrift floating up the creek. </li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff found logs floating and moored them; subsequently they were lost and came into the possession of defendants, who refused to give them to plaintiff, contending they had found them adrift, and asserting a sufficient property in the logs as to any but the original owner. Plaintiff brought an action in trover to recover the value of logs from defendant.

#### Case: *[Anderson v. Gouldberg](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-anderson-v-gouldberg.aspx)*
-Converter v. Converter (Earlier Possessor Won)

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> One who acquired possession of pine logs by trespassing upon the land of some third party had a right to retain that possession against mere wrongdoers who were strangers to the property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs harvested lumber while trespassing and took the logs to the defendants’ mill, where the defendants took them. The possessor of personal property filed action to recover the possession of 93 pine logs with damages. The possessor claimed that he cut the logs in question and hauled them to a mill from which place strangers took them. The logs in controversy were not cut upon the land of the strangers, and consequently they were entire strangers to the personal property. The trial court entered a judgment for the possessor even though it had found that the possessor had trespassed upon the land in question. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Is possession of personal property sufficient title to enable the possessor to recover the property from a stranger who took the property?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> Possession only raises a presumption of title. One who takes property from the possession of another can only rebut this presumption by showing a superior title in himself, or in some way connecting himself with one who has. One who acquires possession has a right against a mere wrongdoer who is a stranger to the property. Any other rule leads to an endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals in every case where property once passes out of the possession of the rightful owner. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court affirmed and found that plaintiff obtained possession of the logs in the first instance by trespassing upon the land of some third party. When it was said that to maintain replevin plaintiff's possession must have been lawful, it meant that it must have been lawful as against the person who deprived him of the property. Possession was good title against the entire world except those having a better title. Possession only raised a presumption of title. One who took property from the possession of another could only rebut the presumption by showing a superior title in himself or in some way connecting himself with one who had superior title. The court held that one who acquired the possession of property, whether by finding, bailment, or by mere tort, had a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who was a stranger to the property.</li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
    - Replevin v. Trover
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - Armory rule should apply. Finder = Converter
    - Possession title whether by finder, bailment or by mere tort has a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who was a stranger to the property.
  - Later case came to the opposite result.
    - Later converter won against prior converter.
    - Rare since wrongdoers typically do not present themselves in court.

#### Jus Tertii Defense (Not applicable) - Right of the Third Person
- A suit for possession of personal property cannot be defeated by showing that someone else has a better claim.
  - A v. B cannot claim that C has better claim than both
- Rejected by courts as a defense.
  - Common law involves only the 2 parties of the case and no Jus Tertii Defense
    - Jury may lack information on a party not involved in the case
    - Jury cannot make a ruling on information not available


### 3.3 *Nemo Dat*
- *"One cannot give that which one does not have"*
  - You cannot buy the Brooklyn Bridge
- *"Prior in time is prior in right"*
- Property rights are always exclusive
  - Two persons cannot hold the same property right at the same time.
- Current owners must be able to trace their ownership back in time through a series of legitimate transfers (ideally) to an act of legitimate original acquisition.
- Generic name for land (Black Acre)

### 3.4 Adverse Possession

- "Squatters Rights"
  - Ordinarily a tort - Trespass
- Adverse Possessor's right is good against all including the owner so long as Adverse Possession Doctrine is fulfilled.
  - Example: A is the true owner. Adverse possession happens when B becomes the possessor without A’s consent. B might be the owner or have other rights (e.g., easement).
- Applications to both real and personal property
- **Elements** to Adverse Possession
- For possession to be adverse, it must be (1) under claim of ownership; (2) actual or hostile; (3) open, notorious, and visible; (4) continuous and uninterrupted for a period of 10 years; (5) exclusive; and (6) peaceful. The claimant must prove each element by clear and convincing evidence. - *Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.*
  1. **Actual Claim of Ownership**.
    - Actual Entry giving exclusive possession
    - Triggers Statute of Limitations
    - Stakes out property to be claimed
      - Must fly his flag over the property in such a way as to put the actual owner on notice that the property is being held under an adverse claim of ownership.
        - Quality of acts not Quantity
  2. **Exclusive**
    - Possessor evinces an intention to possess and hold land to the exclusion of and in opposition to, the claims of all others and conduct must indicate that he is exercising the dominion of a sole owner.
  3. **Open & Notorious & Visible Possession**
    - Penalizes owner for sleeping on their rights
      - Test is objective
    - Possessor must unfurl his flag on the land and keep it flying so that the actual owner may see, and if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains, and planted the standard of conquest. - *Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.*
  4. **Possession that is continuous for the statutory period**
    - Need not be constant just match average owner's use
  5. **Hostile Possession that is Adverse**
    - Possession is hostile and adverse when the adverse possessor intends to claim title notwithstanding that the claim is made under a mistaken belief that the land is within the class of possessor's deed.
    - Under a claim of right (color of title)
  6. **For the Statutory Time**
  7. Optional
    - **Peaceful** (Non-Standard)
    - Sometimes payment of property taxes (Non-Standard)

- Justification of Adverse Possession
  - . . . the doctrine apparently affords an anomalous instance of maturing
a wrong into a right . . .
  - It’s not about the merit of the possessor, but the demerit of the one out of possession. We want people to use land in a useful way.
  - The purpose of adverse possession is to “automatically quiet all titles which are openly and consistently asserted, to provide proof of meritorious titles, and correct errors in conveyancing.
- Economics: Holmes was invoking diminishing marginal utility of income.
- Psychology: Holmes was anticipating prospect theory, which holds that people are more upset by losing something in hand than by forgoing the opportunity to realize an equivalent gain.
- Morality: the new possessor depends on the property, and it’s wrong for the original owner to establish and then cut off that dependence.
- Environmental: Assumption that land should be developed when perhaps for environmental purposes land should be left to its own devices.


#### Case: *[Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-scott-v-anderson-tully-co.aspx)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Substantial evidence in the record supported the chancellor's finding that an adjacent landowner proved adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence where it openly and notoriously possessed the disputed 20-acre tract, marked the perceived property line, and managed and harvested timber from the property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> π filed suit seeking damages after ∆ removed timber from a 21 acre parcel of land that π claimed to own. Scott inhereted 1/2 interest in 584.5 acre tract of land. ∆ alleges that adjacent landowner to the east, ∆ was trespassing on a portion of the estate. ∆ argued that it acquired title to the property by adverse possession through its possession and use of the land from 1969 to 2010.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b>Whether ∆ had acquired the disputed 20 acres of land through adverse possession.</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> For adverse possession it must be 1. under claim of ownership; 2. actual or hostile; 3 open notorious. and visible; 4. continuous and uninterrupted for a period of 10 years; 5. exclusive, and 6. peaceful</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> ∆ demonstrated claim of ownership by marking its borders with recognizable company blue paint. Widely known to local population. Cleared land and timber and issued 5 hunting licenses for the property. π argues ∆ did not actually or hostilely possess the property because it did not care for or improve the land on a regular basis. Generally required for adverse possession, but possessory acts necessary to establish a claim of adverse possession may vary with the characteristis of the land. If wild or unimproved land, may be established by evidence of acts that would be wholly insufficient in the case of improved or developed lands. Public acts of ownership sufficient. The Court held that substantial evidence in the record supported the courts finding that the company, an adjacent landowner, proved adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence where it openly and notoriously possessed the disputed 20-acre tract from 1969 until the purported owner's complaint was filed in 2010, the adjacent landowner marked its perceived boundary line with blue paint when it purchased the property in 1969 and repainted the boundary line in 1986 and 1998, the adjacent landowner managed timber uninterruptedly from 1969 to 2010 and harvested timber in 1990, 1999, and 2010, and no testimony was presented that the purported owner or anyone else used the disputed property after 1969.
     </li>
    <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>
  </ul>

</details>

- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>
  - π asserts claim because he began paying property taxes on the disputed tract in 1993
    - No evidence to support claim by π.
    - Payment of taxes alone is not dispostive of the claim of ownership
  - Proof of adverse possession of wild land is measurably lower than had the property been developed.

#### Claim of Right
- The adverse possession doctrine has no application to one who actually knows that he has no claim or title or right to a title.
  - Main purpose is to bar mere squatters from the benefits of adverse possession.
  - Three Positions
    1. Adverse under a claim of right means that the AP **subjectively (but mistakenly)** believes he is legally entitled to possession of the property. **(The AP is acting in good faith)**
      - *Carptenter v. Ruperto*
    2. Adverse under a claim of right means that the AP subjectively believes he is not legally entitled to possession of the property. (The AP is acting in bad faith) (Main Rule) = (No Jurisdiction follows this rule)
    3. The AP's subjective state of mind is irrelevant; all that matters is that the AP has not been given permission by the TO to use the property. (Conneticut Rule)

#### Color of Title
- Evidence (like a written deed) that appears to establish title but actually does not
  - (e.g., because the original seller lacked a valid title, or because the seller was not competent to transfer the property).
  - Some jurisdictions require color of title others do not
  - Gives AP advantages
    - AP of partial black acre **with a color of title** could have claim to **whole black acre**
      - (NY Follows Advantage)
      - Requires following of custom to determine if activity = encolsure, improvement, possession.

#### Problems with Adverse Possesson & Disability
- Disabilities: some disabilities render property owners incompetent to transfer ownership of their property, e.g., dementia.
  - A disability is immaterial unless it existed at the time when the cause of action accrued (i.e., when the adverse possessor first. took possession of the land).
  - Traditionally, the three Is: infancy, insanity, imprisonment.
    - O owns the property in 1984. A enters adversely on May 1, 1984. The age of majority is 18. The statutory period is 21 years, unless the owner is disabled, in which case the AP must still reach the 21-year period and can then gain ownership ten years after the removal of the disability.

#### Boundry Disputes
- **Doctrine of agreed boundaries**: if the boundary is uncertain, an oral agreement between neighbors is enforceable if they accept the line for a long time.
- **Doctrine of acquiescence**: long acquiescence is evidence of an agree- ment fixing the boundary line


#### Adverse Possession Against the Government
- Adverse possession does not apply to the government
  - Very high monitoring costs that would be involved to ensure to adverse possession.
- The doctrine has been retained in some states, modified in others with a longer statute of limitations against the government than against private owners and has been abololished in others.


#### Case: *[Carpenter v. Ruperto](https://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/resources/p/casebrief-carpenter-v-ruperto.aspx)*
- Outlier of Adverse Possession.
  - Rarely explicitly stated that AP requires good faith under claim of right.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> The property owner knew she had no legal right to possession of the disputed land; therefore, she could not establish a good faith claim of right, and the trial court properly found against her in her action to quiet title to the piece of property.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> The property, which plaintiff claimed to have acquired by adverse possession was the south 60 feet of defendants' lot. She claimed open, exclusive, hostile, adverse, and actual possession under a claim of right. She installed a propane tank on the parcel and used part of it as a driveway. The trial court held in part that she did not establish her possession was under a claim of right. However, it ordered defendants to "do equity" by deeding to her the strip of land her driveway was on and to pay the costs of moving the propane tank to her lot. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the appeal and dismissed the cross-appeal. </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> Did plaintiff fail to prove a good faith claim of right?</li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> One claiming title by adverse possession must establish hostile, actual, open, exclusive and continuous possession, under a claim of right or color of title, for at least ten years, by clear and positive proof. Because the law presumes possession under regular title, the doctrine is strictly construed. </li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court held that good faith was essential to adverse possession under a claim of right. Plaintiff failed to prove a good faith claim of right. She knew her lot did not include the cornfield north of it. At the time she entered possession of the disputed land, plaintiff knew she had no legal right to do so. Possession for the statutory period could not be bootstrapped into a basis for claiming a right to possession. Defendants' cross-appeal was untimely and compliance with he time limitations for taking a cross-appeal was mandatory and jurisdictional.</li>

- Claim of Right v. Color of Title
- <span style="color:red">**Class Discussion**</span>


#### Case: *[Howard v. Kunto](Link)*
- Demonstrates the court's ability to clean up property issues through adverse possession.
- First, tacking is allowed for two adverse possessors in privity with each other. Second, seasonal use satisfies the requirements for adverse possession if the ordinary use of the property is seasonal.
- Tacking = Joining consecutive periods of possession by multiple people as a single period of possession.
  - Generally, tacking is allowed if successive possessors are in privity. The reason is that squatters should not be able to profit from tres- passing.66 But in this case, because all occupants acted in good faith on an erroneous deed, privity should not be required. Tacking is allowed here.

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Ten year summer occupancy and continued improvements to land sufficient to constitute defendants' continuity of possession for purposes of tacking and establishing right to title based on adverse possession.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Defendants' house stood on one lot while their deed described the adjacent lot. At the time quiet title action was commenced, defendants occupied the disputed property less than a year. The lower court found defendants unable to establish a claim for adverse possession because they failed to prove continuity of possession to permit tacking of defendants' possession to their predecessors'. The court concluded that a ten year summer occupancy did not destroy continuity of possession for purposes of adverse possession because the land was regularly used during the time it was capable of use and defendants made continued improvements on the land. As a result, the court found tacking permitted. The court determined the privity requirement for tacking was satisfied because defendants' claim of right as the last of successive purchasers who received title under the mistaken belief they acquired a contiguous track was sufficiently above that of a trespasser.</li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b>Reject the conclusion that the summer occupancy only of a summer beach home destroys the continuity of possession required by statute. It is not necessary that the occupant should be actually upon the premises continually. If the land is occuped during the period of time during the year it is capable of use, there is sufficient continuity. Furhter, adverse possession is permitted if the successive occupants are in privity. Held that sufficient privity of state to permit tacking and thus establish adverse possession as a matter of law.</li>

  Lot Occupant|  -   | Kuntos   | Moyers   | Howards

- **Continuous != Continual**
  - Continuous = Without Interuption
  - Continual = Happens Repeatedly
- The court rejects the conclusion that summer occupancy only of a summer beach home destroys the continuity of possession required by Wash. Rev. Code § 4.16.020
- Continuity of possession may be established although the land is used regularly for only a certain period each year.
- The rule which permits tacking is one of substance and not of absolute mathematical continuity, provided there is no break so as to sever two possessions. It is not necessary that the occupant should be actually upon the premises continually. If the land is occupied during the period of time during the year it is capable of use, there is sufficient continuity.
- A purchaser may tack the adverse use of its predecessor in interest to that of his own where the land was intended to be included in the deed between them, but was mistakenly omitted from the description.
- Tacking of adverse possession is permitted if the successive occupants are in "privity."
- What about Howard? Is he left without property?

#### Case: *[Moore v. Regents of the University of California](Link)*

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Overview:</b> Physician's use of patient's cells in medical research without the patient's permission did not state a cause of action for conversion because the patient had no ownership interest in the cells after they left his body.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> Review was sought of appellate court's decision, which found plaintiff stated cause of action for conversion when defendants used plaintiff's cells in medical research without permission. The court found plaintiff stated cause of action for breach of physician's disclosure obligations. Physicians seeking patient consent for medical procedures must disclose personal interests unrelated to the patient's health that may affect medical judgment. Defendant did not properly disclose personal interests in plaintiff's cells before he operated, thus plaintiff stated cause of action for breach of disclosure obligations. The court reversed and held use of plaintiff's cells without permission did not state conversion cause of action. Plaintiff did not retain ownership interest in cells after they left his body and thus could not assert conversion claim. Conversion should not lie because it would discourage medical research of cells and patients are adequately protected from abuse because of informed consent laws.
 </li>
    <li><b>Issue:</b> </li>
    <li><b>Rule:</b> To establish a conversion, plaintiff must establish an actual interference with his ownership or right of possession. Where plaintiff neither has title to the property alleged to have been converted, nor possession thereof, he cannot maintain an action for conversion. While it ordinarily suffices to allege ownership generally, it is well established that a complaint's contentions or conclusions of law do not bind courts. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, Cal. Health and Safety Code § 7150 et seq., permits a competent adult to give all or part of his body for certain designated purposes, including transplantation, therapy, medical or dental education, research, or advancement of medical or dental science. The act does not, however, permit the donor to receive valuable consideration for the transfer.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed the appellate court's decision, finding plaintiff did not state conversion claim when defendants used plaintiff's cells in medical research without permission because plaintiff had no ownership interest in cells after they left his body; plaintiff did state claim for breach of physician's disclosure obligations.</li>
