<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> Even though an applicant had a legal right to his appointment as justice of the peace, he was not entitled to a mandamus because the act giving the U.S. Supreme Court authority to issue a mandamus to an officer violated the Constitution.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <ol>
      <li>Did Marbury have a right to the commission?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. The commission was complete when the President signed it and the Secretary of State affixed the U.S. seal.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>If Marbury had a right to the commission, did he have right to a legal remedy? When can courts review the executive’s actions?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. Acts “in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion . . . are only politically examinable” i.e., they are beyond judicial review. But when the act arises under a legal duty, “and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . ”</li>

          <li>The Rule of Law: <i>“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”</i> Compare to Louis XIV: “The State, it is I.”</li>

          <li>The question of whether an officer as an individual has a vested right in his appointment, and therefore whether the President can remove him at will, is for the courts. Therefore the courts can review Marbury’s dispute.</li>

          <li>Whether a right is vested is a question for the courts to decide and is not coferring <b>the political question doctrine</b>.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>If Marbury had a right to a remedy, was it a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court? Can the Court enforce the remedy? Can the Court declare a statute to be unconstitutional? Why?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system, authorized the Supreme Court to issue mandamus to lower courts or officials. Madison was an official, so mandamus was unavailable only if the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
          <li>Marshall: "The Constitution granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in only two types of cases (those involving ambassadors, etc., and those in which a state is a party). The Constitution’s division of the Court’s jurisdiction between original and appellate meant that it did not intend to give Congress the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction.</li>
          <li>Congress therefore did not have the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction. §13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
          <li><b>Constitutional Supremacy</b>(LINK): the Supremacy Clause established the Constitution as the “supreme law of the land.” so verse the statute, the constitution holds power</li>
          <li><b>Judicial Review (LINK):</b> Limited government requires the Court to review the constitutionality of statutes. “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</li>
        </ul>
