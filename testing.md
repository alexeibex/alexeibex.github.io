<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> Even though an applicant had a legal right to his appointment as justice of the peace, he was not entitled to a mandamus because the act giving the U.S. Supreme Court authority to issue a mandamus to an officer violated the Constitution.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <ol>
      <li>Did Marbury have a right to the commission?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. The commission was complete when the President signed it and the Secretary of State affixed the U.S. seal.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>If Marbury had a right to the commission, did he have right to a legal remedy? When can courts review the executive’s actions?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. Acts “in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion . . . are only politically examinable” i.e., they are beyond judicial review. But when the act arises under a legal duty, “and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . ”</li>

          <li>The Rule of Law: <i>“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”</i> Compare to Louis XIV: “The State, it is I.”</li>

          <li>The question of whether an officer as an individual has a vested right in his appointment, and therefore whether the President can remove him at will, is for the courts. Therefore the courts can review Marbury’s dispute.</li>

          <li>Whether a right is vested is a question for the courts to decide and is not coferring <b>the political question doctrine</b>.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>If Marbury had a right to a remedy, was it a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court? Can the Court enforce the remedy? Can the Court declare a statute to be unconstitutional? Why?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system, authorized the Supreme Court to issue mandamus to lower courts or officials. Madison was an official, so mandamus was unavailable only if the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
          <li>Marshall: "The Constitution granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in only two types of cases (those involving ambassadors, etc., and those in which a state is a party). The Constitution’s division of the Court’s jurisdiction between original and appellate meant that it did not intend to give Congress the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction.</li>
          <li>Congress therefore did not have the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction. §13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
          <li><b>Constitutional Supremacy</b>(LINK): the Supremacy Clause established the Constitution as the “supreme law of the land.” so verse the statute, the constitution holds power</li>
          <li><b>Judicial Review (LINK):</b> Limited government requires the Court to review the constitutionality of statutes. “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</li>
        </ul>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b></li>

My desire to work at the European Commission stems from my work in the technology space. While working I became aware of the rising interest in digital privacy and the need for increased scrutiny on how user data is transacted across the internet. It was this interest that led me to work on GDPR compliancy for my company and led to my enrollment in law school. While at the European Commission, I hope to expand my knowledge of technical regulatory issues that transcends traditional national borders. I also hope to increase my understanding of international regulatory law and begin to set a foundation for skills that will increasingly be needed in a globalized world connected through the world wide web. I am a good candidate for this position because my background in technology, which taught me many of the details and intricacies of how code and software works, combined with my legal studies, gives me a unique perspective on how technology and legislation need to work together.


My interest in the legal sector for the DG/Agency is to further expand my understanding of how law and regulatory compliance shapes technological trends. Technology and its growth are one of the most important trends of the 21st century. It is important for both legislative bodies and regulatory agencies to work hand in hand with technologists, entrepreneurs and coders so that rules and laws do not inhibit the ability to experiment and build new technology. Conversely, it is important that the fundamental rights of individuals, such as speech and privacy are upheld as well. It is this balance that strikes me as being of the utmost importance moving forward. Both the people involved on the regulatory side as well as the people on the technology side must work in tandem to ensure the sustained and beneficial growth of technology. An imbalance one way or another could lead to either stifling restrictions that make it so technology cannot flourish and grow, or oppositely no oversight could lead to major issues such as privacy leaks, censorship, and social influence. 2018 was an important year that brought to light many issues on the technology front and how data is being used and sometimes abused. Working for the European Union, which is leading the way in terms of data protection and individual user's data rights will be a formative experience so as to understand the various intricacies of a very complex topic that is sure to continue to influence the lives of the global population.
