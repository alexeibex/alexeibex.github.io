<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> Even though an applicant had a legal right to his appointment as justice of the peace, he was not entitled to a mandamus because the act giving the U.S. Supreme Court authority to issue a mandamus to an officer violated the Constitution.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b></li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b></li>
    <ol>
      <li>Did Marbury have a right to the commission?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. The commission was complete when the President signed it and the Secretary of State affixed the U.S. seal.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>If Marbury had a right to the commission, did he have right to a legal remedy? When can courts review the executive’s actions?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. Acts “in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion . . . are only politically examinable” i.e., they are beyond judicial review. But when the act arises under a legal duty, “and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . ”</li>

          <li>The Rule of Law: <i>“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”</i> Compare to Louis XIV: “The State, it is I.”</li>

          <li>The question of whether an officer as an individual has a vested right in his appointment, and therefore whether the President can remove him at will, is for the courts. Therefore the courts can review Marbury’s dispute.</li>

          <li>Whether a right is vested is a question for the courts to decide and is not coferring <b>the political question doctrine</b>.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>If Marbury had a right to a remedy, was it a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court? Can the Court enforce the remedy? Can the Court declare a statute to be unconstitutional? Why?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system, authorized the Supreme Court to issue mandamus to lower courts or officials. Madison was an official, so mandamus was unavailable only if the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
          <li>Marshall: "The Constitution granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in only two types of cases (those involving ambassadors, etc., and those in which a state is a party). The Constitution’s division of the Court’s jurisdiction between original and appellate meant that it did not intend to give Congress the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction.</li>
          <li>Congress therefore did not have the power to expand the Court’s original jurisdiction. §13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.</li>
          <li><b>Constitutional Supremacy</b>(LINK): the Supremacy Clause established the Constitution as the “supreme law of the land.” so verse the statute, the constitution holds power</li>
          <li><b>Judicial Review (LINK):</b> Limited government requires the Court to review the constitutionality of statutes. “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</li>
        </ul>
  <li><b>Rule:</b></li>

<b>Case: <i>[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee](https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/b6a39380-672b-4b93-8fdb-f7bb6d7d8c42/?context=1000516)</i></b>

<details><summary>Case Brief</summary>

<ul>

  <li><b>Overview:</b> The Supreme Court of the United States had appellate power over a final judgement from a state court of appeals because the matter concerned an issue arising under a treaty of the United States.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiff appealed from the Court of Appeals of Virginia which found for defendant in plaintiff's action of ejectment, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed. The court of appeals refused to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court because it determined that the appellate power of the Supreme Court did not extend to the state court of appeals. The case was once again brought to the Supreme Court on writ of error.</li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the Supreme Court of the United States has appellate jurisdiction over the state court of appeals.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial power of the United States, except in courts ordained and established by itself; and if in any of the cases enumerated in the constitution, the state courts did not then possess jurisdiction, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (admitting that it could act on state courts) could not reach those cases, and, consequently, the injunction of the constitution, that the judicial power "shall be vested," would be disobeyed. It would seem, therefore, to follow, that congress are bound to create some inferior courts, in which to vest all that jurisdiction which, under the constitution, is exclusively vested in the United States, and of which the supreme court cannot take original cognizance. They might establish one or more inferior courts; they might parcel out the jurisdiction among such courts, from time to time, at their own pleasure. But the whole judicial power of the United States should be, at all times, vested either in an original or appellate form, in some courts created under its authority.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>
  <li><b>Notes/Concepts:</b> The Court’s power to review state court decisions and the constitutionality of state court decisions is well established. See §25 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789</li>

<b>Case: <i>[Baker v. Carr](Link)</i></b>

<details><summary><i>Case Brief</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview:</b> Voters' complaint against state officers and election officials alleging that a state statute arbitrarily appointed representatives without any logical or rational formula presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action.</li>
  <li><b>Facts:</b> Plaintiffs, residents of several counties, filed a complaint against defendants, state officers and election officials, alleging that a state statute arbitrarily and capriciously appointed representatives without reference to any logical or rational formula and that it deprived them of the equal protection of the laws in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>
  <li><b>Issue:</b> Whether the District Court may declare a malapportionment legislature unconstitutional without raising a political question.</li>
  <li><b>Rule:</b> A federal court cannot pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because it is irreconcilable with the United States Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> The court reversed and remanded, holding that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection presented a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which plaintiffs were entitled to a trial and a decision. The right that plaintiffs asserted was within the reach of judicial protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. </li>
